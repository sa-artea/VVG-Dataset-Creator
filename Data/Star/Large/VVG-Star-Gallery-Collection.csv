The painting had to depict the harsh reality of country life, so he gave the peasants coarse faces and bony, working hands. He wanted to show in this way that they have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish ... that they have thus honestly earned their food. He painted the five figures in earth colours something like the colour of a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course. The message of the painting was more important to Van Gogh than correct anatomy or technical perfection. He was very pleased with the result: yet his painting drew considerable criticism because its colours were so dark and the figures full of mistakes.

He did them in Arles, in the south of France, in 1888 and 1889. Vincent painted a total of five large canvases with sunflowers in a vase, with three shades of yellow and nothing else. In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single colour, without any loss of eloquence. The sunflower paintings had a special significance for Van Gogh: they communicated gratitude, he wrote. He hung the first two in the room of his friend, the painter Paul Gauguin, who came to live with him for a while in the Yellow House.

The walls and doors, for instance, were originally purple rather than blue.. The apparently odd angle of the rear wall, meanwhile, is not a mistake on Van Goghs part the corner really was skewed. The rules of perspective seem not to have been accurately applied throughout the painting, but this was a deliberate choice.

Pollard Willow is a detailed watercolour. On the horizon, Van Gogh carefully drew the railway depot at Rijnspoor station in pen and ink. The lampposts, the locomotive, from which smoke rises, and the small figure of the signalman with his flag are all rendered with great precision. He then completed the scene using watercolours.

Where they follow the outline of his head, they form a kind of halo. The painting is also one of Van Goghs boldest colour experiments in Paris. He placed complementary colours alongside one another using long brushstrokes: blue and orange in the background, and red and green in the beard and eyes. The colours intensify one another.

The execution of the painting is deft, smooth and thin so thin in places that the ground layer and transparent green base colour are still visible.

The objects were probably lit from three sides: not only by the window on the left, but also from above and by a lamp in front of the basket to the left.

He painted The Bridge at Courbevoie in a single session, focusing on the reflections in the water. He was less concerned with using correct perspective or with the proportions of the human figures. Van Gogh used dashes of paint in all sorts of colours, side by side and sometimes layered. This was his own free variation on Pointillism. That method was familiar to him from the work of artists such as Georges Seurat (1859-1891) and Paul Signac (1863-1935).

The thing struck me greatly; those two cottages, half decayed under one and the same thatched roof, reminded me of a couple of worn-out old folk who make up just one single being and whom one sees supporting each other, he wrote. The subject continued to fascinate him. Four years later, in France, he returned to drawing and painting old houses.

He first covered the towel with a bright pink ground layer of lead-white pigment mixed with red. This pink base formed a vivid contrast with the green paint he used for the garden.

He scratched away some of the deep black lithographic ink in the hat to suggest a gleaming stripe.","F0985","JH0286","d0183V1962","60.0 cm x 36.0 cm","With his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, after January 1883; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; given on loan by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, since 22 October 1931; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh on 10 July 1962 to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam; agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","Vincent van Gogh","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","Data\Img\d0183V1962\vangoghmuseum-d0183V1962-800-rgb.jpg","Data\Img\d0183V1962\vangoghmuseum-d0183V1962-800-bw.jpg","[800, 470, 3]","[800, 470]","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=drawing","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Genre=figure (representation)","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Place=The Hague","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1882","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1883","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost"

He believed it to be a deaths head moth, its coloration astonishingly distinguished: black, grey, white, shaded, and with glints of carmine or vaguely tending towards olive green; its very big.. . He drew the moth with black chalk, paying considerable attention to the details. He applied the tone of the wings by carefully rubbing the chalk away. Van Gogh used a fine pen and brown ink to fill in the legs and antennae, added a few little lines to the wings and drew an extra outline around them. He accentuated the dark parts of the moth by thickly applying brown ink. He used the same ink with a pen and brush to draw a frame around the image. There was a particular reason Van Gogh drew the emperor moth rather than painting it, as [he wrote](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let776/letter.html) to Theo: To paint it I would have had to kill it, and that would have been a shame since the animal was so beautiful.

He wrote to his friend, the artist Emile Bernard, It does NOT look Japanese, and its actually the most Japanese thing that Ive done.","F1420","JH1501","d0349V1962","49.0 cm x 61.0 cm","Sent by the artist from Arles to his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, 13 July 1888; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; given on loan by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, since 22 October 1931; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh on 10 July 1962 to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam; agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","Vincent van Gogh","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","Data\Img\d0349V1962\vangoghmuseum-d0349V1962-800-rgb.jpg","Data\Img\d0349V1962\vangoghmuseum-d0349V1962-800-bw.jpg","[635, 800, 3]","[635, 800]","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=drawing","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Genre=landscape (representation)","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Place=Arles","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1888","localhost","localhost"

He admired that approach and sought to achieve something similar in his own work. Van Gogh described this drawing in [a letter](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let782/letter.html) to his brother Theo as a hasty study (letter 782). All the same, he rendered the tassel hyacinths in considerable detail, opting for the Japanese manner and drawing the little flower buds close-up, against a blank background. He went over the pencil lines in brown ink using a fine brush. Van Gogh painted Tassel Hyacinths shortly after entering the psychiatric institution at Saint-Remy. Drawing a precise floral study like this might have helped comfort and sooth him.
