Many of Van Goghs ideas about love and women prove to have been inspired by the literature he read: above all by the books Lamour (1858) and La femme (1860). He went so far as to describe these didactic treatises on the ideal relationship between man and woman they should become two-in-one and together bring about something real as his gospel. Michelet argues that a woman can only really be happy within marriage and under the guidance of the right man. He sets out the tasks and duties of each party and explains how the security and support provided by the husband combined with the devotion and purity of the wife can lead to a divine unity. Michelet advocated a vigorous and active love. Men who were not prepared to protect and rescue a woman should be ashamed of themselves. Van Gogh had a copy of LAmour.

The plural peeen is pronounced the same as peen. In all likelihood hanniken is a dialect variant of hakken (to hack or to hoe). Sugar beets or mangel-wurzel (mangold) plants grow so close together that they have to be thinned out to prevent crowding. The literal meaning of de peen hakken or hanniken could therefore be to thin out a row of beets.

For the first few miles out of Stoniton she walked on bravely always fixing on some tree or gate or projecting bush at the most distant visible point in the road as a goal and feeling a faint joy when she had reached it. Later on when Hetty looks for a pond in which to drown herself Eliot writes: At last she was among the fields she had been dreaming of on a long narrow pathway leading towards a wood ...

His mood was sombre his behaviour was considered strange and unfriendly and he kept to himself. This change began after he left the Loyers (FR b2723 b2726 b2728 and b2729). Mrs van Gogh thus told Theo on 15 August 1874: Im always afraid that especially when Anna goes away Vincent will not take enough care he was really so thin ... Vincent will also not have had it easy at the Loyerses Im glad hes no longer there there were too many secrets there and no family like ordinary people but he will surely have been disappointed by them and his illusions will not have been realized real life is different from what one imagines (FR b2715). On 28 April Anna wrote about Vincents behaviour to Theo: I believe that he has illusions about people and judges people before he knows them and then when he finds out what theyre really like and they dont live up to the opinion he formed of them prematurely hes so disappointed that he throws them away like a bouquet of wilted flowers without looking to see whether or not there are some among those wilted flowers which when handled with care are not quite rubbish yet. Im very sorry that I visited him during the Christmas holidays and was a burden to him. If I had had any reason beforehand to suppose that he would be like that Id certainly have found some way or other of arranging things differently. I havent told this to Pa and Ma they think hes a great support to me and that appears to reassure them greatly (FR b2333). Van Goghs remark is probably also connected with his impending transfer to Paris which he seems not to have wanted.

"let065",,"The year should read 1876 see Date","Van Goghs future had been a subject of discussion during his stay with his parents in December. This prompted Mr van Gogh to write on 31 December 1875 to Theo: What will happen to Vincent we do not know yet. He is certainly not happy. I believe it is not the right place for him there. We had a private chat to discuss matters. Yesterday he went to Uncle Cor to talk things over with him as well he is after all a businessman. I almost think I will have to advise Vincent to hand in his resignation in about 2 or 3 months (this in confidence!). ... There is so much good in Vincent. For that reason though it might be better to make a change in his position. The letter closes with a postscript: Vincent is back. Uncle Cor advised against it. We shant hurry things all of this in complete confidence between the two of us! (FR b2385). Vincent returned to Paris on Monday 3 January and the next day Mr van Gogh wrote to Theo: But how happy and grateful we are that you take pleasure in your work. If only V. had that too! His outlook on life does tend to be a bit too morbid. When he enthuses so much about the pale hues of Mariss paintings I wish his taste would incline more towards the expression of more vigorous life of stronger or more vivid colours even if it were below the norm. He left yesterday morning at half past eight and thought it better not to decide straightaway about changing jobs. He has promised however to keep a close eye on what awaits him there and to try and act wisely. We hope for the best but are not without worry. There is a lot of eccentricity in him but much good as well. We keep our sights fixed on God. He can put worries and troubles to shame (FR b2225 4 January 1876). Mr van Gogh also wrote about this matter to Lies who then told Theo: Pa says that although he is irreproachable he lacks the strength to get ahead on his own and to get a grip on himself (9 January 1876 FR b2226). When Vincent had had his talk with Boussod and had told his parents of his dismissal Mr van Gogh again poured his heart out to Theo: This business with Vincent continues to worry us terribly. On the 4th of this month he wrote to say that when he went to wish Mr Boussod a happy new year the meeting turned very unpleasant. For one thing his going home at the end of the year had been very much resented. Indeed he should not have done so but it seems he was very determined. After that meeting according to him he had no choice but to resign as from April 1st. ... Though we do not forget that God can be our support and help even now we are terribly grieved about everything. How much he has spurned! What bitter sorrow for Uncle Cent. What a bitter experience. We are glad that we live in relative isolation here and would really like to shut ourselves in. It is an unspeakable sorrow. I advised him today after making it clear to him that he should not have left his work for any reason whatsoever at the end of the year when it became apparent to him that he was needed that he should tell Mr Boussod frankly that he regretted his error. Later in the letter Mrs van Gogh takes the pen: after first expressing her disappointment she writes: what a disappointment for you too dear Theo we can understand you commiserate with us we see no light but know that the good Lord has so often given it when things were very bleak. We will hope for it Uncle Cor to whom Vincent also wrote sent us a very sympathetic answer but could offer no help either certainly not in his firm (FR b2227). The close of the letter seems to indicate that Uncle Cor had said he had no place for Vincent in his own art dealership in Amsterdam. Four days later it became apparent that Vincent had had another talk with Boussod about which Mr van Gogh wrote: I had advised him to speak to Mr Boussod and he did so and was not received unfavourably ... There is certainly a lot of good in him. If only he could acquire a bit more tact to make an agreeable impression (FR b2228). Vincent had not intended to resign as emerges from a remark made by Mr van Gogh on 3 January 1876 in a letter to Theo: he means to stay there but will decide later what seems best (FR b2224). His dismissal was not rescinded however.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first verse reads thus: Tell me the old old story Of unseen things above Of Jesus and His glory Of Jesus and His love. Tell me the story simply As to a little child For I am weak and weary And helpless and defiled. Quoted from The methodist hymn-book. London 1954 no","Uncertainty as to the edition makes it impossible to tell which hymn Van Gogh meant. Dozens of editions were available in 1876","Dwight Lyman Moody an American evangelist drew large crowds in the United States and led wide-ranging evangelization campaigns in both the United States and England. The singer and song writer Ira David Sankey was his accompanist and travelling companion. Sankeys hymns were published in two volumes Sacred songs and solos (1873) and Gospel hymns (1875-1891) both of which enjoyed widespread popularity. Van Gogh refers here to numerous evangelical gatherings organized by Moody and Sankey which were held in London between February and July 1875. An illustrated account of the service held in The Agricultural Hall at Islington appeared in The Graphic 11 (20 March 1875) pp. 270 276-277. See also W.R. Moody The life of Dwight L. Moody. London n.d","Passage from the second verse of Tell me the old old story (see n. 1) which ends thus: Tell me the story often For I forget so soon The early dew of morning Has passed away at noon","Van Gogh mistakenly took George Eliot the pseudonym of Mary Ann (or Marian) Evans to be a man. He refers here to Silas Marner: The weaver of Raveloe (1861) chapter 2: that life centring in Lantern Yard which had once been to him the altar-place of high dispensations ... These things had been the channel of divine influences to Marner they were the fostering home of his religious emotions they were Christianity and Gods Kingdom upon earth. Ed. Edinburgh and London n.d. p. 11 (Novels of George Eliot vol. 3). Van Goghs appreciation of this passage contrasts sharply with its function in the novel see Sund 1992 pp. 28-29","Goupil and Co. published a photogravure of Philip Lodewijck Jacob Frederik Sadees Apres le depart.

Because it had hung in our drawing room we wanted to give it to her as a souvenir of it and hope you will approve (FR b988 Mr van Gogh to Theo 5 August 1878)","The identification of this Mr Reid poses problems. Van Gogh must have made his acquaintance when he was working for Goupil in London. The respectful way in which Van Gogh refers to him as Mr Reid (cf. also letters 84 and 93) implies that he was either older than Van Gogh or had a more important position which means that this is most likely a reference to the art dealer George R.

He doesnt know how to come by pupils though. He imagines that Mr Stokes would be willing to let him go. If he senses this even more strongly he will even take the initiative himself. So the situation is not clear. If he truly has a passion for the church or evangelizing and is really serious about it I should think that he could start his studies here and we could see if funds could be obtained but it would take at least 8 years. For that matter it would perhaps be best for him to look either there or here but possibly better here for a position as a bookkeeper or an office clerk or shop assistant.

"let117",,"Theo appears to have had renewed contact with the woman he was in love with. Several remarks made by his parents reveal the consternation this caused and show how they attempted to impose their standards on their children. Mrs van Gogh wrote: still it was disappointing to notice that you are not yet strong and if you dont yet feel strong you dont avoid the dangerous places and risk temptation ... It seems to me Theo that the girl does not respect the promise she knew you made to your parents. And if she truly wanted to act sensibly she would not have spoken to you first. Dont make yourself and us unhappy it may be difficult to make a sacrifice but your love is based on sensuality and you must open your eyes to the danger in order to flee it all the more forcefully (FR b2533 21 May 1877). Mr van Gogh issued Theo a stern warning the same day. His reaction is especially revealing as regards their view of the matter: Havent you heard enough from Jan Carbentus? Ive seen so much of it. That is why such a relationship is so wretched and loathsome because it lacks any moral foundation and is based on material interest combined with sensual desire. A man a young man a young man of good family as you are you would be throwing yourself away if you let yourself be tempted again to enter into a relationship that you cannot expect to be a happy one. I appreciate your having written to us. I am not saying that you acted wrongly in your demeanour towards her. But Theo! I beg you do not let her be deluded into thinking that you are a young man of common character. Do not let her find you in places and streets where others promenade and if you must pass by such a street remember to avoid any appearance of being stuck on someone etc. which one finds among the young people who promenade there. Tell yourself that you will not let your life take that pitiful course. Sacrifice pleasure if it is pleasure but console yourself that it is better to be very reserved than too abandoned. But you can and must have pleasure and diversion only I beg you do not seek it in people of that kind. Your whole future depends on it. Jan Carbentus said it himself. I was made unhappy by such a meeting in the street (FR b2532 21 May 1877). After this Theo told his parents that he wanted to change his situation (FR b2534 31 May 1877).

Wim Heijen who has researched this family thinks that it was probably Isaac Teixeira de Mattos a retired doctor who could have volunteered as a teacher at the Israelitische Godsdienst Armenschool (Jewish School for the Poor) from 1871 a continuation of the Nederlandsch-Portugeesch-Israelitische Armenschool (Dutch-Portuguese-Jewish School for the Poor). In the account-book of the Portuguese-Jewish community Isaac Teixeira de Mattos occurs frequently as a moneylender. At the beginning of the nineteenth century two members of the Teixeira de Mattos family had been members of the board of governors of the Portuguese school for the poor. Another candidate is a nephew of the aforementioned another Isaac Teixeira de Mattos (in 1881 an office clerk) who felt compelled to become involved in the care of the poor. See SAAm I. van S.

Mr van Gogh also wrote to Theo on 22 July (FR b985) Mrs van Goghs letter had already been written on Thursday 18 July (FR b995)","During Mr van Goghs visit to Brussels on 16 and 17 July the possibility of finding a place for Vincent at the Flemish training college for evangelists was discussed. This college which had been founded in 1875 was located at Sint Katelijneplein 9. See Fagel Van Gogh in Brussel pp. 23-27 Verzamelde brieven 1973 vol. 1 pp. 180-182 and Lutjeharms 1978. Mr van Gogh had incidentally done some preliminary spadework having corresponded in June with the Rev. Hendrik van den Brink at Roeselare (FR b981 b982 and b997) this was the same Van den Brink in whose house Theo had been a lodger at the beginning of 1873 (see letters 3 and 9). Mr van Goghs letter which was enclosed with Vincents gave Theo a detailed and illuminating account of the visit: I recently sent you a postcard saying that I would be going with Vincent to Brussels. We were there last Tuesday and Wednesday and spoke to and visited a great many people. We have determined that with payment from us for his keep we shall embark on a trial period of three months to see if there is a chance of his succeeding. Vincent spoke perfectly well and I believe he made a good impression. His stay abroad and the last year in Amsterdam have not been wholly fruitless and he does manage if he opens up to give proof that he has already learned and observed much in the school of life. Meanwhile the matter of evangelization in Belgium cannot yet count on permanent funds but is mostly begun and continued in faith. In general however when funds were necessary they were not lacking. The Rev. Pieterszen of Mechelen joined us there and took us to see the Rev. de Jonge in Brussels who had invited us to stay with him. But because the annual fair was taking place in his neighbourhood and there was a chance that we wouldnt be able to sleep at night because of the noise in the street he found us accommodation with an elder of the congregation a certain Mr Geerling Architect. A most delightful family who received us so cordially. Evangelists in Belgium are not required to obtain a certain degree or qualification after earlier training but can be appointed if they give proof of suitability. It was nice that we were accompanied by the Rev. Jones for whom Vincent had worked in England. He came to visit us the previous Saturday and stayed until Tuesday at which time he went with us to Brussels. Hes a kind man who made a good impression on all of us. In Brussels he also spoke well on Vincents behalf and his very presence meant that these matters were usually discussed in English which gave Vincent the opportunity to show that he spoke it readily and correctly for which he received a pat on the back. We are now waiting for a letter with details of when and how after which he will begin. May there be something for him. It seems after all that he has a certain vocation for this kind of work though I pointed out all the dark sides to him. But he remains adamant (FR b985 22 July). Cf.

"let149","Absolutely nothing none whatsoever. Van Gogh uses this adverb ganschelijk here for the first time (probably under the influence of Flemish)","Since a longer stay at the Flemish training college at Brussels had become impossible (see letter 148) Van Gogh left for the Borinage to seek a position as an evangelist. Around the beginning of December 1878 he went to live in Petit-Wasmes a village in the south of Belgium. Mr van Gogh had meanwhile written to Theo about this on 15 December: A week ago we received a rather good letter from Vincent. Good inasmuch as he has found good lodgings with a Protestant farming family at Paturages. For 30 francs a month so little because he instructs their children in the evenings. He has been received there with kindness by many people and associating with those people appears to fulfil his expectations. Moreover the Rev. Peron at Dour has promised his assistance. In mid-January there will be another meeting of the Committee of which the Rev. Peron is secretary and he will try to further Vincents interests. Meanwhile he spends his free time drawing large maps of Palestine which could be of use to schools and confirmation classes and which he hopes to dispose of for money. I received one from him and ordered 4 more copies for which I will give him 10 francs each. So now we are relieved inasmuch as he has good accommodation for the present and otherwise well wait and see. Especially now that its so wintry were glad that he has initially ended up there and in that colliery country there will certainly be no lack of opportunity to warm oneself. Accordingly he writes that in his room too he has a fire in the grate and clothing and simple but healthy fare (FR b2448). The above-mentioned Rev. Peron is Pierre Peron who worked for the Eglise protestante unie de Belgique from 1869 to 1882. A new situation for Vincent had thus been arranged fairly quickly. On 5 December Mr van Gogh had sent a frank letter of recommendation to Peron at Dour in which he said that Vincent had refused to take money from him not wanting him to bear the expense. (See Documentation 5 December 1878). Evidently two more letters followed addressed to Nicolaas de Jonge and Abraham van der Waeyen Pieterszen because on 8 January 1879 Mr van Gogh confided to Theo: I wrote again in his behalf to Brussels and Mechelen (FR b2455)","On the last day of the year Mr van Gogh wrote to Theo making sure he had Vincents exact address and asking him to write soon to Vincent in Belgium (FR b2452)","The description suggests that Van Gogh has Durers Ritter Tod und Teufel (Knight Death and the Devil) in mind of which he stressed the same aspect in letter 148","This room known in popular parlance as the Salon du Bebe and Le temple du Bebe was located at what is now rue du Bois 257-259 in Petit-Wasmes.

Van Gogh qui voudrait etre occupe dans le Borinage) [p. 173]. The minutes go on to say: The Chairman introduces the application for employment from Mr van Gogh son of a minister from Holland who has come to the Borinage with the aim of working there. From what Mr Pieterszen and Mr Peron say it emerges that this devout young man completely devoted to work would make a good Bible reader and would do useful work in that capacity in Wasmes and Warpignies. Mr Peron suggests employing him in this way at the modest salary of 600 francs. There will be a trial period of 6 months (M. le President fait connaitre la demande demploi de Mr van Gogh fils dun pasteur de Hollande et venu dans le Borinage dans le but dy travailler.

The minutes of 15 April 1879 report the situation to date: Attention is drawn to Mr Vincent and his work.

"let150",,"For Theos visit see Date. Mr van Gogh wrote to Theo: How commendable of you and comforting to us your recent visit was. It was a veritable tonic after that journey in Vincents behalf and the worries about Lies (FR b2464 10 March 1879)","Mr van Gogh had gone to see for himself the conditions in which Vincent was now living. The Evangelization Committee had meanwhile appointed him to a post for a trial period of six months. Mrs van Gogh wrote to Theo on 19 January 1879 telling him that Vincent had informed them of his appointment as an evangelist in the mining region. The extract issued on 22 January from the Zundert register of births deaths and marriages was no doubt connected with this (FR b1508): His work is holding Bible classes instructing children visiting the sick all fortunately work after his own heart and 50 francs a month. Its for six months at first but its a beginning for which we and he are very grateful and glad. He is indeed so pleased and describes his work extremely varied and among many people with great satisfaction and would like to walk with you too in that beautiful countryside. Its a wonderfully heartening idea that he now has a steady position which could lead to better things (FR b2456). Mr van Gogh repeated the news a day later working out for Theo that Vincent after paying 30 francs for board and lodging would have 20 francs left for himself and went on to add: He also went down a mine shaft 635 metres deep (FR b2457 20 January). The venture was not entirely successful however. Mr van Gogh thinking he had good reason to worry left for Mons on Wednesday 19 February. Mrs van Gogh wrote a detailed letter to Theo on Thursday 27 February: And now I must tell you that Pa has gone to see Vincent this week with all that bad weather we werent at ease especially because while I was away we received a very grim letter from him which confirmed all our worries that he had no bed no bed-clothes no one to wash his things. But he wasnt complaining at all saying instead that it didnt concern anyone and so on. We were getting a package ready for him but we both thought it would be so much better if Pa were to take it himself. Rev. Pieterszens answer was so long in coming. So there was no waiting for it. On that awful Wednesday Pa left at half past two to be at Mons at half past eight in the evening. He left with wishes and prayers that the faithful father wouldnt be taken ill. I had ordered the trap to take him to the railway station and does it surprise you we were sad following his [Vincents] footsteps? And just imagine that same evening we had a letter from Vincent and one from Verhaegen a colporteur to whom Pa also wrote in the beginning who had received Vincent warmly his first week there and who found him those good lodgings with Denis. Vincent said in his letter that one of these days we would probably hear an unfavourable report of him resulting from a visit an inspection visit I think made by Rev. Rochedieu of Brussels which led to a meeting of gentlemen from the district and the church council of Wasmes at which they talked about him and he wrote what shall we do now Jesus was also calm in the face of the storm and evil can turn to good and perhaps things would have to get worse before they got better he wrote no more than that. And Verhaegen wrote a very sweet personable letter saying that Vincent despite all the advice he and many other concerned people had given him had left Denis where he had been so well taken care of and was now living in that hut and had no bed and no clean clothes. It had been decided that if he refused to listen to their advice he would lose his post. And thats why he wrote hoping that fatherly advice would keep him from going astray. So you can imagine no matter how worried I am how grateful I am that Pa has gone there its as though he was sent may God bless. Pas visit will certainly be useful I think Pa will take him back to Denis. I was so deeply grateful that Pa hadnt read those two depressing letters before his journey. But you can understand how much were longing for his return keep this to yourself who knows how it will turn out but it cant go on like this anyway even if things are now put to rights. He is too obstinate and pigheaded and doesnt listen to advice. You dont know dear Theo what sorrow it gives us and how much we worry about so many things ... It does seem dear child that apart from Vincent who is very strong you do not come of strong stock ... Pa hoped to come home this evening but now since there is surely so much for Pa to discuss I dont expect him before tomorrow (FR b2463). In the 3rd report of the Belgian Christian missionary church of Wasmes 14 March Van Gogh appears one last time as a young man. This report was drawn up by Augustin Lefevre: The young man of whom I already spoke recently at the departmental meeting that he was looking for a post as a gospel teacher this young man has been placed by the Pastors of the national church to evangelize among the divided choristers who are still split into two groups. (Le jeune homme dont jai deja parle dernierement a la reunion sectionnaire quil cherchait une place comme instituteur evangelique ce jeune homme est place par les Pasteurs de leglise nationale pour evangeliser aux chanteurs separes qui sont encore divises en deux bandes.) Van Gogh fulfilled this function between January and July 1879: In 1877 a singing group was set up within the church at Grand-Wasmes. As it met in the same premises as the Sunday school and wished to occupy them at the same time Lefevre advised them to look for another place in which to practise or to change the time. That caused discontent and two factions formed in the church one supporting the evangelist the other supporting the choirmaster. An inquiry was even undertaken in the name of the administrative Committee of the Belgian Christian Missionary Church and the authorities retained Lefevre at the head of the community. There was a split. The dissidents joined other Protestants in the church at Paturages and they rented a disused room there the Salon du Bebe and held their meetings there. From July 1877 they asked minister Peron to preach the gospel to them and during the months from January to July 1879 the synodal committee of the Belgian evangelical Protestant Church sent them Mr Vincent van Gogh. Information from Yvon Brohez Bureau du Synode Eglise protestante Unie de Belgique Brussels 5 February 2003","These ministers were Pierre Peron (cf. letter 149 n. 1) Herman Nicolas Neven and Jean Andry (cf. letter 154 n. 3).

Denis was married to Estere Fievez (AEM Wilkie 1978 pp. 56-68 and Eeckaut 1990 Annexes p. 23). At first Van Gogh wanted to live on his own but his parents were against the idea and managed to dissuade him: Im afraid that he is completely wrapped up in nursing the injured and sitting up with them at night. That is very good of him but he already has so much to think about for which he needs a clear head. He also mentioned a plan to rent a labourers cottage and live there alone. We advised against it. Were afraid that he wouldnt keep it very tidy and that it would again lead to eccentricities. At any rate perhaps hell listen to advice but again there are worries on the horizon (FR b2460 Mr van Gogh to Theo 12 February 1879). A month later Mrs van Gogh enlightened Theo: You will also approve of Vincents letter but he sent back the money intended for Denis for taking care of him so how can those people launder his clothes?

He went to Sint-Maria-Horebeke (a small village c. 50 km west of Brussels) and Tournai (a city c. 40 km north-west of Wasmes) to ask acquaintances for help and advice (see also n. 6 below). The evangelization committee whose demands he had failed to meet had given him three months to look for another situation. He was judged to be lacking in several qualities necessary to perform his duties namely the ability to speak eloquently and to organize meetings at which the community could be uplifted by hearing the message of the gospel. Van Goghs successor Hutton would succeed within two months in turning around the deteriorating situation as emerges from the minutes of a meeting of the church council of Wasmes: The trial made in accepting the services of a young Dutchman Mr Vincent Van Gogh who believed himself called to evangelize in the Borinage has not yielded the expected results. If to the admirable qualities he displayed among the sick and injured to the devotion and spirit of sacrifice of which he furnished many demonstrations watching with them at night and divesting himself for them of most of his clothes and linen had been added a gift for speaking indispensable to anyone placed at the head of a congregation Mr van Gogh would certainly have been an accomplished evangelist. It would not of course be reasonable to ask for extraordinary talents. But it is a fact that the absence of certain qualities may render the performance of the evangelists primary function totally deficient. Unfortunately that was the case with Mr van Gogh. Therefore once the trial period had expired we were obliged to abandon the idea of keeping him longer. The evangelist currently employed Mr Hutton took up his post on 1 October 1879. The work he has done so far is extensive and has already borne fruit. Mr Hutton has re-established the meeting that had been established by Mr Peron in Warquignies and had lapsed under Mr van Gogh. But it seems to have been seriously compromised due to that neglect because it is continuing with difficulty. (Lessai qui a ete fait en acceptant les services dun jeune homme Hollandais M. Vincent Van Gogh qui se croyait appele a evangeliser dans le Borinage na pas donne les resultats quon en attendait. Si aux admirables qualites quil deployait aupres des malades et des blesses au devouement et a lesprit de sacrifice dont il a fourni maintes preuves en leur consacrant ses veilles et en se depouillant pour eux de la meilleure partie de ses vetements et de son linge setait joint le don de la parole indispensable a quiconque est place a la tete dune congregation M. Van Gogh aurait certainement ete un evangeliste accompli. Sans doute il ne serait pas raisonnable dexiger des talents extraordinaires.

Son activite jusquici a ete grande et a deja porte des fruits. M. Hutton a retabli a Warquignies la reunion qui avait ete inauguree par M. Peron et etait tombee sous M. Van Gogh. Mais son abandon parait lavoir serieusement compromise car elle se soutient avec peine.) See Vingt-troisieme rapport du Comite synodal devangelisation 1879-1880. Etterbeek-Bruxelles 1880 pp. 17-18 (Union des eglises protestantes de Belgique). Excerpts printed in the Verzamelde brieven 1973 vol. 1 pp. 227-228. In his recollections of the lEglise Protestante of Petit-Wasmes the chronicler Antoine Denis remarked that Van Gogh was losing his mind [and] becoming ... a responsibility (perdait la tete [et] devenait ... une charge). (An extract from the archives of this church was kindly supplied by minister Ruben Quenon in 1973 a copy of the manuscript is to be found in the Dossier Pierre Secretan-Rollier Amsterdam Vincent van Gogh Foundation). Vincents parents saw no way out of the situation and Mr van Gogh complained to Theo: We are sorely tried by this and are literally at our wits end (FR b2487 19 July). A letter written by Mr van Gogh to Theo on 5 August makes it possible to reconstruct events: Weve had another letter from Vincent. He has left Wasmes and is now at Cuesmes near Mons. He writes that last Friday he went to Maria-Horebeke in Flanders arriving there Sunday afternoon mostly on foot to meet Rev. Pieterszen who was in Brussels. He then went there and met him on Monday morning after consulting him he is now back in Cuesmes and there hes found accommodation and hopes in future to find a small room ... In Brussels he visited the various families he had become acquainted with there. What kind of impression will he have made? Like a ?.... Oh we can imagine almost anything! His letter was written in a rather cheerful tone mixed with bitterness. Tomorrow it will be ten years since he left our house and I brought him to The Hague to work in Goupils firm. What troubles weve had since! ... We are tired and all but despondent ... I wrote this morning to Vincent and to others in his behalf. In the main I do not object to or condemn what he is doing. I think it best to leave him to his own devices but we watch him with trepidation and remain ready to come to his aid if necessary. We invited him to come home but he definitely doesnt want that (FR b2488). One of the others to whom Mr van Gogh had written in Vincents behalf was the Rev. Abraham van der Waeyen Pieterszen whose answer arrived in Etten on Sunday 7 August (FR b2491 10 August Mrs van Gogh to Theo). Pieterszen had no solution. Vincent had arrived at his place on Sunday evening [i.e. 3 August] weary and flushed: He was given good accommodation and invited to breakfast the following morning. He made the impression on everyone who saw him that he is someone who gets in his own way. He had lost a lot of weight. I sent Pieterszen 50 francs to give him without his knowing that the money had come from me. Pieterszen had advised him to go to us but he didnt want to. Then however he went to Cuesmes ... Can he go on evangelizing on his own account? P. thought that would be best. But where would the financial means come from? Should I go and visit him to try and get him to come here? What will become of him? (FR b2488). This letter was probably one of the reasons Theo decided to visit Vincent (see letter 154). In Brussels Van Gogh had also gone to see the family of Otto Geerling at whose house he showed up looking dirty and bedraggled. See Lutjeharms 1978 p","Edouard Joseph (or Joseph Edouard) Francq traceur maitre (a foreman in the coalmine) at Cuesmes was married to Celeste (Celestine) Julie Batalje (Bataille).

A four-day stay with his parents had helped him to regain his strength somewhat and he had started to wear presentable clothes such as his fathers favourite new cardigan and his summer jacket as well as Theos old underwear. He had also acquired a new pair of boots. His new attire did little to improve his behaviour however: he kept to himself and seemed to be developing facial tics: He reads Dickens all day long and does nothing else speaking only when required to answer a question often correctly often oddly if only he would benefit from the good in those books not a word about anything else his work his past or future were not in a hurry for he must recover fully.

"let155","Written in English","The last surviving letter dates from between about 11 and 14 August 1879 (letter 154). There is now a gap of one whole year in the correspondence also in that of the family as a whole. Tension conflicts and disagreements about Vincents future led to ill will and seem to have been the cause of letters being withheld from publication or destroyed. One gathers from remarks made by Vincent later on that in 1880 his father had planned to have him committed to a lunatic asylum in Geel (Belgium) the earliest mention of this occurs in letter 185. Cf. Hulsker 1990-2 and Jansen et al. 2003-2. The tone of the letter suggests that Vincent felt compelled to respond to Theos reproaches. Mr van Goghs letter to Theo of 5 July contains his reaction to the mention of Vincents letter: That letter from Vincent really gives me pleasure but oh what will become of him and is it not ridiculous to choose a life of poverty and to let an opportunity slip by without seeking a means of earning a living? That really is absurd but we have to resign ourselves to the fact. Nothing of all that we have tried has had any effect. Do write back to him. At the end of June I sent him 60 francs upon which he sent a reply. Later on we sent him a box of clothes. It always pains us to think of him. And we think of him constantly (FR b2494). Part of the letter has been cut out (probably a postscript). Mrs van Gogh wrote the same day: Have you sent him an answer if not be sure and do it. We were so glad he thought of you again and found it so sad when he didnt want to see anyone here (FR b2495).

"let172",,"Van Gogh usually looked for models among the Protestant parishioners. In 1924 Piet Kaufmann stated that he had posed for Van Gogh some thirty to fifty times (Stokvis 1926 pp. 19-21). In 1934 Kaufmann had his memoirs recorded in detail by Frans Schuerweghs. He said that he had posed dozens of times in numerous places: beneath a row of trees probably also with a wheelbarrow at the willows under the apple tree as a sower as a man with a spade ... under the apple tree at De IJzeren Pot the farm where I lived and in Roosendaalseweg with a hoe ... Whenever I posed and the work was finished Vincent asked how much he owed me. I answered: Nothing Vincent. Well Piet then were done he would say satisfied.... Kaufmann in any case is assumed to have posed for the following drawings: Boy cutting grass with a sickle (F 851 / JH 61 ) Digger (F 855 / JH 43) and Digger (F 859 / JH 29). It is also possible that he appears in Sower (F 866a / JH 27) and Kneeling man planting (F 879 / JH 62). Kaufmann also names another model: On Minus van Oostenrijks land where he was ploughing he drew Minus as a ploughman.

This tree for example has boughs that are vigorous healthy strong juicy with sap and you understand at first glance its strength and weightiness.

I left Roosendaal early on Monday morning. Immediately on arriving I called at the institution but could not see the director who is also a doctor before 2 oclock because he was engaged in an operation. I couldnt see the patient either before 3 in the afternoon. Then to Mauve who was away travelling and his wife out shopping. Then to Tersteeg also not at home before 1.30. Then I did speak to Mr. Tersteeg but he knows nothing about Vincent. V. had broken off all relations since Tersteeg had pointed out to him that it was not fitting that at his age he should be supported by his brother. Vincent had concluded from this that Tersteeg and Mauve had urged you to not to send your contribution any more and that idea seems to have made him agitated again. Tersteeg knew these details from you or from your letters. At 2 oclock I spoke to the doctor. When I enquired about the patient he said that his illness was catarrhal in nature and that he appeared to be in need of rest. But he saw no objection and allowed me to go to him and to speak to him again (the doctor) after my visit. Vincent was somewhat surprised to see me a little touchy but I put him into a normal mood and promised to return the next day. He does not look at all wasted his pulse is calm and otherwise quite normal. He had complaints about Uncle Cor that he had judged his drawings so coolly. Van Rappard had seen them and thought them very good. That Rappard remains loyal to him and had later written to him again to encourage him. We spoke for quite a long time and then it was time for me to go to Leiden. I told Vincent that when he was allowed to leave the hospital he could come to us to get his strength back but while he appreciated the offer he thought it better not to avail himself of it because he wanted to get back to work. Yesterday morning at 10 oclock I returned from Leiden and went to see him again. And I asked the doctor to let me know if Heaven forbid there was a change for the worse. Before that however I drove to his house where the people said they didnt really know where the gentleman was. He had said he was leaving the city for 14 days but they believed he was in the hospital. They couldnt show me his studio because they hadnt got the key. Now I heard from him that he had heard from his model about that package we had sent. He had got my letter and the enclosure but that letter was inside the package so the model must have opened the package. Can there be any danger in that so-called model? When I left I secretly gave him a piece of paper from Anna with some ox-tongue but not a lot to which I added a 10-guilder coin. He had refused to take money from me. There he pays 10.50 guilders per 14 days always in advance. He had been there eight days and he showed me his receipt. As I left I whispered to him that he must be careful with the small packet I had given him because there was something else in it (I meant that coin). He stuffed the packet under his mattress. He remains singular and I have no great expectations. But if only he does not sink lower and lower and does not throw himself away on an unworthy person. That avoidance of people who want to help him along is an unfavourable sign. When the time came for other visitors to arrive I noticed him looking towards the door uneasily. Can it be that he was expecting a visitor someone that he would rather I did not meet? Dont say that I think the worst. I say this to no one else but you and you will understand how I mean it truly not to burden him but in part out of fear. There is in him an inclination towards the lower classes and sometimes a person can enter into an improper connection out of perversity or a sense of desolation. You understand though we are not now afraid of this illness turning out badly we continue to be concerned about him and that concern has not diminished. He also talked about wanting to take another house in the same neighbourhood where he would have better opportunities ... What a support you are for Vincent. Bye old chap!

Black may thus be considered in the variety of its shades as the basis of all the colorations nature presents ... By mixing black with the three primary colours we obtain the following broken tones: with blue blue grey with red red grey with yellow yellow grey. If we add red to blue grey we will have purplish grey thus less cold. If we add yellow to blue grey we will have a warmer grey ... Now nature never offers anything but an infinite variety of these greys and the four colours that we call essential will always be able to render them.

Toutefois il est indispensable que le peintre y joigne le noir ...

Si au gris bleu nous ajoutons le rouge nous aurons le gris violace par consequent moins froid. Si au gris bleu nous ajoutons le jaune nous aurons un gris plus chaud ...

The American press turned against him and he was accused of being the mouthpiece of British publishers. Dickens incorporated his experiences and his objections to such things as slavery in the satirical American chapters of Martin Chuzzlewit (which appeared in book form in 1850). In the preface Dickens wrote about the earlier clashes with the Americans. When he also published American notes which included an attack on the American press irritation escalated into a wrangle that would continue for 25 years. When Dickens was preparing for a new visit for a series of readings in 1867 he toned down his pronouncements in a foreword he wrote to Martin Chuzzlewit which was being published in American newspapers. Through this conciliatory gesture he won over public opinion and the tour was a success. See Martin Chuzzlewit. Ed. Margaret Cardwell. Oxford 1982 pp. 855-856 Dickens on America & the Americans. Ed.

This is symbolized by an initiation ceremony that ends with the drinking of a glass of water. Each of the three chapters in the book deals with an episode in the life of a painter. The first Francis wants to join the Buveurs deau but is found to be too bourgeois he is destined to become a mediocre artist. The painter Antoine renounces his love for a young woman in favour of art. The painter Lazare in the last chapter also thinks he must choose between love and vocation but here the open ending implies that a serious relationship is possible after all","Given that the context is the bohemian life Van Gogh is more likely to mean the genre painter Henri Charles Antoine Baron than the landscape painter Theodore Baron","There are various painters among the characters in the novels of Honore de Balzac. The most important are: Joseph Bridau in La rabouilleuse (1842) Pierre Grassou in Pierre Grassou (1839) Dubourdieu and Leon de Lora in Les comediens sans le savoir (1846) Hippolyte Schinner in La bourse (1832) Theodore de Sommervieux in La maison du chat-qui-pelote (1830) Frenhofer in Le chef-doeuvre inconnu (1831) and Servin in La vendetta (1830). See Wingfield Scott 1936 pp. 8-13 275","Claude Lantier is a character in Zolas novel Le ventre de Paris (1873) which Van Gogh had read a few months before (see letters 245 and 250). Later he is the protagonist in Zolas Loeuvre (1886). Van Goghs suspicion that the painter was done from nature was right: the figure was partly based on Paul Cezanne. Lantier lives entirely for his work and aspires to a new contemporary art in which things are shown in their true light. This is the first time that Van Gogh uses the term Impressionism. Both here and in several later Dutch letters (e.g. 450 467 and 495) it is evident that he has not yet fully understood the exact meaning of the term. It was only when he moved to Paris that he became aware of the latest developments in painting. After that he used the term in a broader sense than normal see letter 569 n. 2","Meissonier did several studio scenes in which a painter or draughtsman is seen from behind. Van Gogh probably means The painter (1855) The Cleveland Museum of Art. Ill. 252 .

Ed. Paris 1950 p. 735 (chapter 60).

We quote the whole passage here because Van Gogh comes back to it in more detail in the following letters (the numbers between parentheses are those in the original catalogue): And though we should be disposed to put Leon Lhermitte at the head of all those who exhibit here for the most potent secrets of strength and command of effect in black and white there are English designers both of the figure and landscape such as Gregory and Small who come but little behind him in these points and English landscape painters like Powell and Hunter to say nothing of departed masters like George Cattermole whose mastery of broad and strong effect does not fall below his. To such qualities in his black and white as delicacy of draughtsmanship exquisiteness and sweetness of effect and refinement of expression Lhermittes work makes no pretension. It assails the imagination by a rude massive and primitive strength akin to that which impresses us in the monuments and buildings the life and faith of that Brittany from which he derives most of his subjects and in which his genius seems most at home. How eminently favourable this stern simplicity is to effect in such materials as chalk and charcoal we may test by noting the distinctness with which the memory retains that simple street in Dauphine (461) with its broadly distributed masses of black and white those grim grey-black fortress-like houses at Landerneau (311) in which we trace the kinship of Brittany and Wales so irresistibly do they remind us of Caernarvon or those grave prayerful women (259) kneeling round the rude coast-shrine (the Ker-Saint or holy-house) on the naked rock that goes plumb down to the angry sea of Finisterre or almost more remarkable for its strong simple grasp on the picturesque elements of the subject that corner of a Breton market-place (194) with the satisfying harmony got out of the white caps and dark dresses of its gossiping and bargaining commeres the deep hollows of the doorways and the light and shadow playing on stalls and booths and overhanging pent-house roofs or the Procession (114) with the canopied host marshalling cross and waving banners the white-veiled communicants at the head of the train and the more darkly and humbly clad forefathers and foremothers of the hamlet bringing up the rear on the winding way along the hollow road up the hill-side to the rustic church that crowns its brow or those robed and tonsured priests in the cloistral half-shadow of their stalls at Notre-Dame (172) or that gaunt and grim Breton beggar-woman over her never-grudged ecuille of soup or that Breton house-wife at her sleepless wheel. It is impossible to forget Lhermittes work. He is at once the Millet and Jules Breton of Black and White and it would be a curious and not useless artistic problem to work out upon his drawings what is the secret of the pathetic effect obtained without delineation indeed with hardly even indication of feature and only the rudest suggestions of form. A. Legros has something of this power but his style is at once dryer and more distinct (see his Beggar and Worshippers at a church-porch of Bruges) (92). Van Gogh uses the plural comptes rendus which may be a reference to other favourable reviews of Lhermittes work such as those by Tom Taylor in The Graphic 15 (23 June 1877) p. 594 and The Graphic 18 (6 July 1878) p. 6 and the anonymous contribution to The Illustrated London News 72 (22 June 1878) p","This remark and the sentence in the next letter to Theo: In the last letter I wrote to you I asked in passing about the work of LHERMITTE (letter 308) shows that a letter or part of a letter to Theo has been lost because Lhermittes name is mentioned for the first time in the present letter to Van Rappard","Workman sitting on a basket cutting bread (F 1663 / JH 272 ).

It seems to me that its going against the grain with him again. One letter is a response to something in a letter from his Ma that she delighted to see the sun shine and that fortunately it shines for everyone. It appears that the poor fellow is in a depressed mood but how could it be otherwise? Every time he looks back at the past and how he has broken with natural states the painful aspects of that must surely make themselves felt? Oh I can easily imagine how hard it must be for him at times. If only he had the courage to consider the possibility that the cause of much of what has arisen out of his eccentricity can be found in himself. But it doesnt seem to me that he feels blame himself but rather bitterness towards others and particularly towards the gentlemen in The Hague. In his second letter he says that he is financially embarrassed. He had expected your allowance but it hadnt come and while the last you sent was more than he needed for his keep he had purchased paints and canvas etc. for his work. Now he had to pay 14 guilders for his board and he noticed that the people were looking at him with suspicion. He asked me if it was possible to advance him the 14 guilders or if needs be half of it. I sent him a 14-guilder postal order by first post this morning. But my dear Theo you must not put yourself in difficulty because of your generous allowance. I can well understand that you have your own concerns and wouldnt it be better if from now on we sent the intended share together? You half and we too? In your last letter you said you dont have to send him money. It could also very well be that he has spent an unwisely large sum on requirements without keeping any cash in hand. I am writing you all this to keep you informed. But let us be cautious towards him for he is evidently in a perverse mood again. How much better it would be (if people dared risk it with him) if he were to board somewhere at a fixed price. But that would only lead to dissatisfaction again. Ma and I are naturally entirely under the impression of his last letters. Part of the letter is missing here. Mrs van Gogh added in the margin: we said so often how we wish he would come without its being necessary while we still have our health but now all that illusion has gone again ...

At first it seemed to be hopeless but it has gradually got better particularly since we agreed that he will stay with us for the time being to make studies here. He wanted the mangle room to be fitted up for him. We dont think its a particularly suitable place but weve had a decent stove put in there. We are having a sort of wooden foot-rest made since the room has a stone floor. We had it spruced up and have even had a bed put in there also on a wooden foot-rest so that it wont be unhealthy. Now we shall just make it nice and warm and dry and then it should do. I wanted to have a large window put in but he prefers it without. Early this morning he went to Utrecht to visit Rappard who urged him to do so. He also deemed it necessary that a collection of drawings and studies which are in The Hague should come here and he plans to go and pack them up because he stubbornly asserted that no one but he himself could do it. You know that once he has made his plans there is no changing them and so he left to return within a few days so he has said. We should rather that he had just left The Hague alone but the matter of his drawings and other artists tools made it necessary so he declared. Anyway were undertaking this new trial with real good faith and are resolved to leave him completely free in his eccentricities of dress etc. The people here have seen him now and although its still a pity that he isnt a little more accommodating: theres simply no changing the fact that hes eccentric. It seems that hes still pretty much occupied with your plans and future but you will be wise enough not to let yourself be talked into things that arent practical. For that is certainly his trouble alas! It is certain that he works hard and that he finds plenty of material for studies here. He made various ones that we think are good.

"let464",,"On 2 October 1884 Mr van Gogh wrote to Theo at length about what had been going on. His account contains some interesting information: We have had difficult days with Vincent again. Apparently he wanted to arrange a marriage with Margot who proved not entirely averse but it came up against insuperable objections on the part of her family too. After news of the business started to leak out Margot went to Utrecht where she still is. Its said that the relationship has been broken off but the friendship will continue. They still correspond constantly. The Dr shes staying with also appears to have told V. that there are physical obstacles that make the affair impossible. At first V. seemed to be taking it calmly and I therefore ventured to be away from home for some days while Wil was home. But this calm gave way to aggression and Wil was very worried by the feeling that he sometimes seemed to have been drinking. She found drink in a field flask of his and this agitated her greatly and she wrote to Anna about it so that she could tell you. Still it turned out on investigation that it was more appearances than fact. But it gave Ma and me a reason to talk to him about it. You know that theres really no talking to him because of the unpleasant tone he adopts. That was the case this time too but in the main that last objection was not in our view so serious. Apparently he gives his models a drink when hes out in the fields with them and he said himself that he therefore occasionally has one too. That could be the case. According to what V. says he sometimes takes a drink in the evening on the Drs advice because he has such sleepless nights. That remedy seems very unsuitable to us. But the business with Margot continues to occupy him very much and he is rather depressed at the moment. We are doing our best to restore him to calm which is the most important thing. But his outlook on life and his ways are so different from ours that its questionable whether living together in the same place can continue in the long run. However we dont want a real separation and are willing to tolerate and attempt everything to the utmost if only he could become a bit normal. We do expect something to come of that in time. There is also a plan that Van Rappard should come to see him and stay with us. We have even urged this it could provide him with a distraction. V. just received your registered letter. He told us that you advised him to do everything he could not to make our staying here impossible. We are hoping for the best. Meanwhile he has noticed that we could leave here if we want to the day before yesterday I received a call to go to Baardwijk a village in the Langstraat close to Waalwijk ... We have so much that is good here that it would be difficult for us to leave. Only if our relations with people were to become difficult because of circumstances then it could come to it. Theres risk enough of that at the moment (FR b2257). Mr van Gogh intended to discuss this call to the village of Baardwijk (North Brabant) on Tuesday 8 October","Octave Mouret is a character in Zolas novels Pot-bouille (1882) and Au bonheur des dames (1883) which Van Gogh described as the second volume (cf. letters 283 ff.). Van Gogh repeatedly refers to this owner of the department store Au bonheur des dames. Mouret is ambitious and competitive and forces the small drapers shops in his neighbourhood out of business so that he can build a large department store. Van Gogh values his modern and single-minded approach which responds to the demand and focuses on expanding the clientele","Bourdoncle is one of the managers in the department store Au bonheur des dames he has a narrow mediocre mind. When there is a temporary minor downturn he fires staff for the smallest thing","This passage was added later the italics and emphasis are not in Zola. Unlike Bourdoncle Mouret has a sensual nature and seeks as far as possible to meet the needs of Parisian women in the stock he sells in the store. At the end of Au bonheur des dames he marries one of his former shop assistants Denise. Bourdoncle represents the businesslike impersonal side whereas Mouret is much more likely to be led by what his heart tells him.

That was a difficult thing for my parents who could not always follow him and often misunderstood him. My father was a stickler for the proper form and he [Vincent] never concerned himself with all that naturally that often caused clashes and neither of the parties readily forgot words that were spoken in anger. So for the last eight years Vincent had been a problem to many people and because of the outward appearances they all too often forgot the great deal of good that was in him. The last few years he worked at home with us after my fathers death Anna thought it would be more peaceful for Ma if he were not to live at home any longer and contrived that he left us. He took that so badly that we have heard nothing from him since then and we only know about him through Theo. I do so hope that he will gradually forget his grievances for it is such a sad relationship and something like this so easily leads to discord (FR b4536. Breda 26 August 1886).

I showed his work again to an old painter (Serrets his name) who has seen and experienced a great deal in his life and has a good heart and a clear head. He told me that he could see in his work that it was done by someone who had been working for a relatively short time but he found a great deal that is good in it. He even said that if he kept on working and could manage to work out his idea he held out the prospect that he would surpass Millet who as you know was one of the greatest painters that ever was in expression. But speaking of success with the public he thought that that would go slowly very slowly. But he went on if it might please him tell him that he has my sympathy entirely.

We already had a lithographic printing works in Eindhoven at that time. He dropped in occasionally to get black printing ink which he appeared to use in his paintings. ... Later he came back again and asked us to prepare a stone for him. After the stone had been treated he started to draw on it straightaway right there in our office. He set to work with a lithographic crayon straightaway without making a sketch beforehand. Nor was there an example. He worked from memory. With broad heavy lines he produced sharp-featured angular heads of a peasant family at a table drinking coffee and eating by lamplight. Although this was evidently the first time hed drawn on a stone he was not at all timid about it. He scratched with a needle and smudged with his thumb and fingers as if he were working on paper. And although my brother told him that one should avoid touching the surface of a lithographic stone with the fingers since it causes spots later he didnt take the least notice much to the surprise and disgust of our lithographer who regarded such work with contempt. After the shapes had been thoroughly scored with the needle again by way of finishing so much so that the person seen in profile had a prominent bump on his nose it had been too deeply scored to cover it up at all so it had to stay like that. Perhaps that was actually his intention because later I saw the painting of the same subject in his studio also with exaggerated caricature shapes and the colours I think were pure Prussian blue and chrome yellow. The stone was etched and then perhaps 100 impressions were made from it which turned out better than our printers had expected. Thats what my brother remembered.

I think it is very fine I said to him but I dont think that it is an antique. He looked at it carefully and then replied: No my dear friend its a Renaissance piece. You see the ancients started from the centres whilst in the Renaissance they started from the line. Look...! He then took a pen and on a sheet of paper drew a series of ovals large medium and small ones then with a light but very intelligent line its clear he linked the tops of these ovals these eggs if you like then finally just adding a little stroke here and there he showed you as if by magic a superb horse rearing up and pawing the ground leaving nothing to be desired as regards movement and life... But tell me how did you discover that? I asked him. Oh! Like this: Mr Gros got it from the Greeks Gericault got it from Mr Gros but not satisfied with that he also adopted it from the Greeks and the Etruscans. (Un matin que nous venions de monter la garde emsemble et que nous rentrions chez moi je lui fis voir une tete en marbre dun des douze Cesars que je venais de rapporter dItalie quelques jours auparavant. Je trouve ceci tres beau lui dis-je mais je doute que ce soit un antique. Il lexamina attentivement et me repondit alors: Non cher ami cest de la Renaissance. Voyez-vous les antiques prenaient par les milieux au lieu que la Renaissance prenait par la ligne. Tenez!... La-dessus il prit une plume et traca sur une feuille de papier une serie dovales grands moyens et petits puis dun trait leger mais bien intelligent cest clair il rejoignait le dessus de ces ovales de ces oeufs si vous voulez puis enfin ajoutant encore un petit coup par-ci par-la il vous montrait comme par enchantement un cheval superbe se cabrant piaffant ne laissant rien a desirer pour le mouvement et la vie...

Read: Het geld voor deze maand (The money for this month).","It is not clear whether Van Gogh was looking for addresses of art dealers from Nuenen (and possibly Eindhoven) or actually went to Antwerp himself. Had he gone in person one would expect him to have shown some canvases to dealers and reported their reactions to Theo. Moreover the wording in letter 541 of about 14 November in which Van Gogh writes that he has come by the addresses of six art dealers would seem to indicate that he did not have them before. And lastly several months later after a visit to the Rijksmuseum (letter 534) he writes that he does not intend to be cut off from paintings by other artists for so long in future. Had he been to Antwerp he would undoubtedly have gone to the World Exhibition and/or the Museum voor Schone Kunsten. On the other hand we do know for certain that Van Gogh went to Antwerp with Anton Kerssemakers. According to Kerssemakerss memoirs however this was after their visit to Amsterdam on 6-8 October 1885. (Cf. Verzamelde brieven 1973 vol. 3 p. 95.) In a letter of 1912 Kerssemakers also recalled that Van Gogh had once been to Antwerp on his own and had brought back a nice surprise. The story is preceded by a brief introduction about a visit to a pharmacist: They then asked the old pharmacist Vrijman for Copahu Balsam and as a curiosity Van Gogh told me that when they asked him whether they could dilute this Copahu with turpentine the pharmacist believing that they had contracted a venereal disease snarled at them havent you done enough damage to your carcass already? which the two visitors naturally found very funny. Kerssemakers himself wrote: In my memoirs in De Amsterdammer I spoke of the singular revenge he had wreaked on that parson in Nuenen but I didnt want to specify it deeming it not really suitable for the general public however I will tell it to you personally counting on your discretion. He came to see me once after a trip to Antwerp and said Ive brought something back from my trip to do that tiresome fellow in Nuenen a favour. Obviously I was very curious as to what this could be and then he showed me a few dozen sheaths (gants damour) I shall hand them out to the peasant lads in Nuenen and see what that does.

In letter 532 Van Gogh had said that he had some still lifes of a basket of potatoes fruit a copper kettle &c. ready for Theo.

Since the only extant still life with a kettle is Still life with a brass cauldron and jug (F 51 / JH 925 ) this must be the one he means (see also letter 532 n. 4).In letter 536 Vincent also mentioned birds nests on a black background (ll. 62-63) which Theo must have been able to picture in his minds eye. It is unclear whether he is referring to one or more still lifes here. Still life with birds nests (F 111 / JH 939 F 112 / JH 938 and F 109r / JH 942) fit the bill.Going by what is or was once in the family estate the following works may also have been in this batch: Beer tankards (F 49 / JH 534) Basket of apples (F 101 / JH 927) Still life with earthenware and bottles (F 53 / JH 538) and Still life with a basket of apples and two pumpkins (F 106 / JH 936). They are now in the Van Gogh Museum. Still life with an earthenware bowl and pears (F 105 / JH 926 ) was sold by Jo van Gogh-Bonger in 1905.

Van Gogh knew that Breitner had studied with Cormon (see letter 465) and may also have heard about him at the academy in Antwerp. Cormon opened his studio at number 104 boulevard de Clichy in 1882. While he did receive his students there corrections were also done in the studio in rue La Bruyere. The syllabus did not differ much from that of his predecessor Leon Bonnat. Cormons was less rigidly structured though and it was above all this more liberal attitude that won him a favourable reputation among a younger generation of artists. Students drew (classical) plaster casts and from life and Cormon demanded from his students an extremely accurate lifelike drawing. He advocated a painting technique based on a dark design on which the painting was worked up with transparent and light colours. He also encouraged his students to work en plein air sketching trips were a regular feature of the timetable. The studio was particularly popular with foreign artists.

In the passage in question the painter Claude Lantier receives a visit from Christine the girl to whom he had offered shelter in his studio two months previously. On that occasion he sketched her portrait. They are pleased to see each other again and talk amicably together until she sees the painting he is working on and recognizes her own face in that of the nude female figure. She feels that her honour has been impugned because it appears as though the painting shows not just her face but her naked body too but she is shocked above all by the direct rough painting. She goes immediately leaving the painter baffled: Anger seized him in its turn: an oath hurled into empty space a dreadful shrugging of the shoulders as if to rid himself of this idiotic preoccupation. Could you ever be sure with women! (La colere le prenait a son tour un juron jete dans le vide un terrible haussement depaules comme pour se debarrasser de cette preoccupation imbecile. Est-ce quon savait jamais avec les femmes!) See Zola 1960-1967 vol. 5 pp. 504-507 (citation on p. 507). Van Goghs assumption that this is about Manet probably has to do with the description of the painting on which Lantier is working which is very reminiscent of Manets Dejeuner sur lherbe.

At that time Andries was living at 80 rue dHauteville (FR b1030) but he was staying with Vincent at 54 rue Lepic as we learn from a letter to his parents (Paris Friday 27 August 1886): My invalids (Vincent van Gogh also fell ill during Theos absence) have hindered me from writing. Otherwise I should have thanked you much sooner for the warmth of the reception you gave Theo. He was in raptures over his stay with you (he got back Thursday morning). It also pleases me greatly that he is to your liking. The longer one gets to know him the more one learns to appreciate his fine mind. He is always entertaining company. I slept at the apartment while he was away because Vincent was alone. ... I now go to eat with Van Gogh every evening as a permanent thing. It does take up a lot of time since he lives in Montmartre and the evenings are now taken up altogether but its more pleasant for us both. The three of us always have plenty to talk about (FR b1844). The flat on the third floor had three reasonably large rooms a tiny study and a little kitchen. ... Vincent slept in the study and behind that was the studio an ordinary room with one not particularly large window wrote Jo van Gogh-Bonger in her introduction to Brieven 1914 p. xlvii","Theo used his stay in the Netherlands to try to get support for his plans to set up his own art gallery with Andries Bonger. He talked to his Uncle Vincent but his uncle saw no merit in the idea. We do not know who else is meant by the Dutch gentlemen but it is reasonable to assume that he also spoke to H.G. Tersteeg. On the basis of Vincents remark about Uncle Cor and Uncle Vincent in letter 659 we can assume that Theo approached Uncle Cor too. A year later on 26 July 1887 Theo was to write to Jo Bonger about his uncles reaction: I had several artists in mind whose work I admired and with whom I was sure I could do business. Andre shared my views and we arranged that I would approach my uncle who had once promised to help me to get the money we needed to carry out our plan and start a business together. My uncle refused to help and fobbed me off kindly at first but later when I persisted quite firmly. Andres attempts to raise funds were no more successful.

During his wanderings Candide encounters a great deal of misery (so that he begins to have doubts) but nonetheless in the end he calls for fortitude with the cry: we must cultivate our own garden (il faut cultiver notre jardin). Later in the correspondence Van Gogh quotes Panglosss maxim about the best of all possible worlds several times more.

Contrary to what Bernard suggested later the works were not Van Goghs way of paying for his meals. He had evidently decorated the cafe with flower still lifes in the hope of selling them to customers albeit without making specific arrangements with Segatori. Maurice Beaubourg stated in 1890 that Van Gogh had left everything behind as security for the proprietor (comme gage au proprietaire) while Bernard wrote that the still lifes were auctioned off in batches of ten. At the beginning of his time in Arles Van Gogh remarked on how few flower still lifes from Paris he had been able to keep (letter 640). There is consequently every reason to assume that he did not collect the works that were decorating the cafe and that they were then sold at auction possibly as part of bankruptcy proceedings.

It is a Naturalist story about a family that falls apart because of the jealousy and rivalry between the two brothers Pierre and Jean. Maupassant prefaced his novel with an essay titled The Novel (Le roman) in which he argues that every literary work should be judged according to the extent that the author has succeeded in realizing his objectives. Modern Realist writers try to capture Nothing but the truth and the whole truth (Rien que la verite et toute la verite) but this means anything but a literal rendition: They will often have to correct events in the interests of plausibility and to the detriment of truth because What is true may sometimes not be plausible. (Ils devront souvent corriger les evenements au profit de la vraisemblance et au detriment de la verite car Le vrai peut quelquefois netre pas vraisemblable.) On the freedom that the artist has to exaggerate he says: The novelist who transforms the unchanging brutal and disagreeable truth in order to extract from it a singular and appealing adventure should without excessive concern for plausibility manipulate events as he pleases and should prepare and organize them so as to please move or touch the reader (Le romancier qui transforme la verite constante brutale et deplaisante pour en tirer une aventure exceptionnelle et seduisante doit sans souci exagere de la vraisemblance manipuler les evenements a son gre les preparer et les arranger pour plaire au lecteur lemouvoir ou lattendrir).

It involves studying everything one wishes to express long enough and with enough attention to find an aspect of it that no one has seen or spoken of. There is an element of the unexplored in everything because we are in the habit of using our eyes only with the memory of what people before us have thought about the things which we are looking at. The smallest thing contains a little of what is unknown. Let us find it ... It is in that way that we become original. (Le talent est une longue patience. Il sagit de regarder tout ce quon veut exprimer assez longtemps et avec assez dattention pour en decouvrir un aspect qui nait ete vu et dit par personne.

He used his reaction as an argument for pursuing his poetic ambitions. On arriving I found a very interesting letter from Vincent which I read and re-read to divert myself because with the wind thats blowing the rain and the cold the countryside although very wild is still really dreary. Vincent congratulates me on my decision about Algeria and tells me that he will perhaps also go to see me there himself. He advises me to build myself up before going for my service which I also believe very necessary although my constitution is not as strong as it looks. In short hes a very good friend very sincere and all his southern exuberance expresses itself (in a northerner) in a deep sincerity. But (theres always a but) he blows up too quickly over unimportant things. He has spoken to me a lot about the lines of verse I sent him and says its not as good as your painting but you must definitely continue with sonnets. There are many pals who think its bad to write. Well! I say that its just as interesting to paint with words as with a brush. So continue.

Il me donne le conseil de me fortifier avant daller au service ce que je crois aussi tres necessaire quoique je sois dune constitution moins gaillarde que jen ai lair.

Van Gogh refers to the son as Gabriel de la Roquette (see letter 625). This must have been a nickname since the womans full name was Evelina Delarebeyrette-Lassarre and her son is always referred to in official documents as Gabriel Delarebeyrette. In letter 686 Vincent talks about Madame de Larebey la Roquette so we know that he did know her real name Theo also calls her La Roquette (see letter 830). They may have called her this because she was so touchy and liable to fly off the handle a roquette is a rocket the fact that it sounds something like Delarebeyrette may also have been a factor. The Delarebeyrettes came from the department of Creuse in the Limousin a region in central France (Archives de Paris). Although Monticellis legendary consumption of alcohol sounds somewhat exaggerated he must nonetheless have been a heavy drinker. He used to do the rounds of the bars in Marseille to sell his paintings and from 1880 onwards he only ever received buyers in his local Cafe Plauchut.

At size 25 figure (65 x 81 cm) F 555 is a fraction larger than its pendant The white orchard (F 403 / JH 1378 ) (60 x 80 cm). It seems strange that in letter 608 Van Gogh calls it the largest of all but this can be explained by the fact that it was the largest work in the first series of orchards (in other words the first two triptychs see letter 597). True the two orchards he painted after that F 513 and F 551 are the same size (and he consequently calls them large studies in letter 608) but he painted them later and his recollection was evidently that F 555 was larger than the rest. Hulsker believed that it was Orchard (F 511 / JH 1386 ) which measures 72 x 92 cm (a no. 30 canvas) he links it with the earlier mention of a no. 30 canvas in letter 591 and the left-hand side of the triptych in the letter sketch in letter 597. See Hulsker 1993-1 p. 50 and Hulsker Het probleem van de Verger rose (Van Gogh Museum Documentation Typescript). However F 511 is not painted on coarse canvas or absorbent canvas it is moreover stylistically more akin to the orchards in blossom done in the spring of 1889. Van Tilborgh therefore argued that this pink orchard was not known and that F 511 dated from a year later. See Gijsbert van der Wal Met de neus op de bloesem. De datering van Vincent van Goghs Boomgaard in bloei in het Van Gogh Museum Jong Holland 17-1 (2001) pp. 23-25. Van Tilborgh and the editors of this edition now assume that all the references to the pink orchard relate to the same painting namely F 555 which Van Gogh incorporated in his sketch of the decoration as pale pink orchard (letter 597).

His brush seems to take on an ethereal quality as it follows the amorous flows of his thoughts in a sort of voluptuous delight.

Although he too took his inspiration from the Japanese examples unlike Anquetin and Toulouse-Lautrec he made great use of impasto and he painted outdoors.

His assumption is probably based on the similarity between Jundt and the character in the novel inasmuch as they are both successful but unhappy painters of peasant life. Bongrand owes his success to his painting La noce au village which hangs in the Musee du Luxembourg. Jundt painted genre works with titles like La fete au village voisin and Pendant la noce. Zolas character is tormented by his inability to equal his masterpiece gout forced Jundt to stop working and he committed suicide (see also letter 776 n. 18).

Ernest Chaplet used the technique in the early 1870s for underglaze painting in coloured slips on pottery and went on to develop it further for the Haviland porcelain factory. The German chemist Herman Seger described the process as follows in 1878: Barbotine means engobe or paste and barbotine painting stands for a method of decoration which is essentially plastic in character bringing out the colors by means of paste... The decoration consists usually of flowers and animal pieces preferably birds which are in a manner painted plastically so to speak. Quoted in Gray 1963 p. 10 (n. 32). Gauguin had made a series of pots and vases together with Chaplet in the winter of 1886-1887 some of which were displayed in Theos gallery in December 1887.

He bore in mind the possibility that this integrated series (he spoke of an ensemble and a whole) could be shown outside the Yellow House and considered exhibiting it in the offices of the Revue Independante.

Let us prefer flaunted flesh to great art (Which as we know consists of great machines In which queens virgins murderesses move Joan of Arc or Catherine de Medici) I dont dispute their indefinable charms Thats everyones right . But the more we plunge into the chasm The more the concept pervades our brain For beneath the oceans eternal depths In the blackest bitterest of abysses The pearl sleeps among the monsters and the weeds The violet beneath the rotted heap of bouquets Exudes a sweet scent that intoxicates intensely. Its the hideous then thats the sole element The crucible from which a world of an abyss escapes Whose form is ugliness whose essence the Sublime. .

Bleak vast revelation of Nothingness.

"let698",,"See letter 692 n. 1 for Gauguin Self-portrait with portrait of Bernard Les miserables and Bernard Self-portrait with portrait of Gauguin . Bernard had suggested an exchange with the group in Pont-Aven (see letter 694). Van Gogh sent seven studies (see letter 704). Two of them Self-portrait (F 476 / JH 1581 ) and Quay with sand barges (F 449 / JH 1558 ) respectively were intended for Bernard and Gauguin in return for their self-portraits. See letter 697 n. 4 and n. 11 below. The other five works were intended for the new exchange with Bernard Laval Moret and Chamaillard. Two can be identified for certain: Thistles (F 447 / JH 1550 ) and The old mill (F 550 / JH 1577 ) which went to Moret and Chamaillard respectively. See letter 696 n. 12 and n. 10 below. Two of the other three studies probably went to Bernard and one to Laval both of whom sent work in exchange (see letter 719 nn. 2 and 3). There was certainly a red sunset (l. 130) going by Van Goghs descriptions in letter 696 of the studies he was thinking of sending the remaining two could have been chosen from the following three: a study of a little garden of multicoloured flowers a still life of old peasants shoes or a small landscape of nothing at all in which theres nothing but a bit of an expanse. The study of a little garden was Garden with flowers (F 578 / JH 1538 ) which Van Gogh probably did send to Pont-Aven given the provenance which is not the family collection. See Roskill 1971 p. 159 (n. 89). Feilchenfeldt identified Garden with flowers (F 578 / JH 1538 ) as the painting of a garden that Jo van Gogh-Bonger sold to Cassirer in March 1908 but that was another work: Daubignys garden (F 814 / JH 2107). See Feilchenfeldt 1988 p. 105 and Account book 2002 pp. 52 148. It is impossible to identify the last work that he sent. The still life of old peasants shoes was Shoes (F 461 / JH 1569 ) but since that was owned by Jo van Gogh-Bonger one can conclude that it was not sent. It is not clear what the small landscape of nothing at all in which theres nothing but a bit of an expanse was (see letter 696 n. 13).

However Van Gogh says that he had set the study in the night cafe where he had painted F 463 and the interior in F 478 does not resemble it. Whats more the scene does not match the description Van Gogh gives here. It is therefore more likely that F 478 is the rough sketch that Van Gogh painted in November 1888 and mentioned in letter 718.

Having felt for 3 years that my powers as an artist were utterly inadequate for the modern forms of progress introduced among the Impressionist artists so quickly replaced by the Neo-Impressionists I decided to work in isolation without being promoted by any group. My studies made in the tropics are inadequate as precise renderings of nature and I believe that the Revue Independante would be powerless to give them the brightness and luminosity they lack.

"let726",,"The Musee Fabre in Montpellier a city about 70 km to the west of Arles housed the collection of Alfred Bruyas. This wealthy collector had become known mainly as the Maecenas of Gustave Courbet. In 1868 Bruyas donated part of his collection to the Musee Fabre and his bequest followed in 1876. The Bruyas Collection contains 142 principally French contemporary paintings (including 17 portraits of Bruyas) 48 drawings and 17 bronzes. Gauguin had visited the Musee Fabre in 1884 and had written about it in his Avant et apres: I made as a young man a journey to the south and at Montpellier I visited that famous museum constructed by and endowed with the entire collection of Mr Bruyas (Je fis jeune homme un voyage dans le Midi et a Montpellier je visitai ce fameux musee construit et donne avec toute la collection par M. Brias). After describing the masterpieces on display there including paintings mentioned by Van Gogh in the present letter he goes on to say: A good many years later I returned in the company of Vincent to visit the museum again. What a change! Most of the old drawings had disappeared and everywhere in their place [were] the Acquisitions of the State 3rd prize. Cabanel and all his school had invaded the museum (Bien des annees plus tard je revins en compagnie de Vincent visiter a nouveau ce musee. Quel changement! La plupart des dessins anciens avaient disparu et de toutes parts a leur place des Acquisitions de lEtat 3e medaille. Cabanel et toute son ecole avaient envahi le musee). See Gauguin 1923 pp. 221-222. Following Merlhes as well as Druick and Zegers we have placed the visit to Montpellier on Sunday 16 or Monday 17 December. The railway journey lasted 2 to 3 hours so Van Gogh and Gauguin probably travelled back and forth in one day to avoid paying for a hotel. On Sunday and Monday the museum was open to the public both morning and afternoon on Thursday only from 9.00 to 11.00. Although Baedeker also says that the museum was open to foreign visitors on other days as well (encore les autres jours pour les etrangers) it is less likely that Van Gogh and Gauguin took advantage of this opportunity.

"let728",,"On the evening of 23 December 1888 Van Gogh suffered an acute mental breakdown. As a result he cut off his left ear and took it to a prostitute in a local brothel. The police found him at home the next morning and had him admitted to hospital. On 24 December Gauguin sent a telegram to Theo who immediately took the night train to Arles. Despite Van Goghs repeated pleas Gauguin did not come to visit him in hospital (see letter 736). Jo van Gogh-Bonger wrote in her introduction to the letters that Gauguin travelled back to Paris with Theo who left Arles on Tuesday 25 December as emerges from a letter he wrote to Jo on 28 December (see Brieven 1914 p. liv and Brief happiness 1999 pp. 70-71). Bernards letter of 1 January 1889 to Albert Aurier (quoted below) agrees with this description of events: he reports that Gauguin had arrived in Paris four days earlier meaning 27 December. After his return to Paris Theo gave an account of his visit in a letter he wrote to Jo on 28 December: I found Vincent in the hospital in Arles. The people around him realized from his agitation that for the past few days he had been showing symptoms of that most dreadful illness of madness and an attack of fievre chaude when he injured himself with a razor was the reason he was taken to hospital. Will he remain insane? The doctors think it possible but darent yet say for certain. It should be apparent in a few days time when he is rested then we will see whether he is lucid again. He seemed to be all right for a few minutes when I was with him but lapsed shortly afterwards into his brooding about philosophy and theology. It was terribly sad being there because from time to time all his grief would well up inside and he would try to weep but couldnt. Poor fighter and poor poor sufferer. Nothing can be done to relieve his anguish now but it is deep and hard for him to bear. Had he just once found someone to whom he could pour his heart out it might never have come to this. In the next few days they will decide whether he is to be transferred to a special institution and as I dont yet know how much I shall have to do in all this I dare not make any plans. Two days later he wrote to her again: Since I last wrote Ive been wavering between hope and fear. The news is still bad and the last letter from Vincents friend the postman says The doctor will wait a few days before deciding whether he should be committed to an institution. One sees the ambiguity in this sentence when one asks Why? I am waiting for an answer from the assistant house physician at the hospital. There is little hope but he has done more than so many in his life and suffered and fought more than most people are capable of doing. If he must pass away so be it but the thought of it breaks my heart ... My dear Mother knows no more than that he is ill and that his mind is confused. She is not aware that his life is in danger (see FR b2020 and b2021 Brief happiness 1999 pp. 70 74). Vincent remained until 7 January 1889 in hospital where he was treated by the resident physician Felix Rey. Rey assisted the chief physician Marie Jules Joseph Urpar. Shortly after Van Goghs admission to the hospital Urpar drew up a certificate regarding the artists condition which was sent to the mayor of Arles on 29 December 1888. The certificate has not survived but it is evident from the accompanying letter to the mayor that the doctor had concluded that Mr Vincent who on the 23rd of this month removed his ear using a razor is suffering from mental disturbance. The treatment that this unfortunate man is receiving in our establishment not being such as to bring him back to a state of reason I am writing to request that you be so kind as to take the necessary steps to have him admitted to a special asylum (M. le Maire Jai lhonneur de vous adresser ci-joint le certificat de M. le docteur Urpar medecin en chef de lhopital constatant que le Sieur Vincent qui le 23 du mois ci sest enleve loreille dun coup de rasoir est atteint dalienation mentale. Les soins que cet infortune recoit dans notre etablissement netant pas de nature a le ramener a la raison je viens vous prier de vouloir bien prendre les mesures necessaires pour le faire admettre dans un asile special) (unsigned transcript of a letter to the mayor of Arles ACA). The copy is not signed. The same day Dr Rey informed Theo of Vincents condition and told him about Urpars certificate (see Documentation 29 December 1888). The incident was reported in the column Chronique locale in the weekly newspaper Le Forum Republicain on Sunday 30 December 1888: Last Sunday at half past eleven in the evening one Vincent van Gogh a painter and native of Holland presented himself at brothel no 1 asked for one Rachel and handed her.... his ear telling her: Keep this object carefully. Then he disappeared. Informed of this act which could only be that of a poor lunatic the police went the following day to the home of this individual whom they found lying in his bed by then showing hardly any sign of life. The unfortunate was admitted to the hospital as a matter of urgency. (Dimanche dernier a 11 heures du soir le nomme Vincent Vangogh peintre originaire de Hollande sest presente a la maison de tolerance no 1 a demande la nomme Rachel et lui a remis.... son oreille en lui disant: Gardez cet objet precieusement. Puis il a disparu. Informee de ce fait qui ne pouvait etre que celui dun pauvre aliene la police sest rendue le lendemain matin chez cet individu quelle a trouve couche dans son lit ne donnant presque plus signe de vie. Ce malheureux a ete admis durgence a lhospice.) As late as 1929 the policeman Alphonse Robert described his recollection of the incident (quoted in Doiteau and Leroy 1939 p. 6). Gauguin later declared that on the evening in question he had decided to sleep in a hotel because of Van Goghs aggressive threathening behaviour. The exact circumstances of the supposed incident between Gauguin and Van Gogh are not known however. Van Gogh says nothing in his letters about its immediate cause and Rey reported the following to Theo on 30 December: When I tried to get him to talk about the motive that drove him to cut off his ear he replied that it was a purely personal matter (Lorsque jai voulu le faire causer sur le motif qui lavait pousse a se couper loreille il ma repondu que cetait un affaire tout a fait personnelle) (FR b1056 Documentation 30 December 1888). Van Gogh remembered little of what happened. This is evident from a note made by Dr Peyron in the asylum at Saint-Remy on 8 May 1889: During that attack he cut off his left ear but he has no more than a vague memory of all that and is not aware of it. (Pendant cet acces il se coupa loreille gauche mais il ne conserve de tout cela quun souvenir tres vague et ne peut sen rendre compte.) See Documentation 8 May 1889. In Avant et apres Gauguin wrote that before finally wounding himself Van Gogh had wanted to attack him that evening: I had already gone almost all the way across place Victor-Hugo [place Lamartine] when I heard behind me a little step that was very familiar quick and jerky. I turned at the very moment when Vincent rushed at me with an open razor in his hand. My look must at that moment have been very powerful because he stopped and lowering his head he ran back in the direction of the house. (Javais deja traverse presque entierement la place Victor-Hugo lorsque jentendis derriere moi un petit pas bien connu rapide et saccade. Je me retournai au moment meme ou Vincent se precipitait sur moi un rasoir ouvert a la main. Mon regard dut a ce moment etre bien puissant car il sarreta et baissant la tete il reprit en courant le chemin de la maison.) See Gauguin 1923 pp. 20-21. Gauguin wrote these words in 1903 long after the events themselves and doubt has frequently been cast on his reliability as a witness. His account will all the same have been based on the truth. In Bernards summary of what Gauguin had told him directly after returning to Paris no mention is made of the attack however. In his letter of 1 January 1889 to Albert Aurier Bernard wrote: Gauguin returning precipitately 4 days ago and the news about Vincent in the hospital. I rushed to see Gauguin who told me this. The day before my departure (for he had to leave Arles) Vincent ran after me (he was going out it was night). I turned around because for some time he had been acting strangely but I was wary of him. Then he told me: You are silent but I will also be silent. Ever since I had been going to leave Arles he was so bizarre that I couldnt take it any more. He had even said to me: Are you going to leave? And when I said Yes he tore this sentence from a newspaper and put it into my hand: the murderer took flight. I spent the night in a hotel and when I came back all of Arles was in front of our house. Then the police arrested me because the house was covered in blood. This is what had happened: Vincent had returned home after my departure had taken a razor and cut his ear clean through. Then he put a big beret over his head and went to a brothel to take the ear to a wretched girl telling her: You will remember me truly I tell you this. The girl fainted immediately. The police set out and came to the house. Vincent was hospitalised. His state is worse he wants to sleep with the patients chases the nurse and washes himself in the coal-bucket. In other words he is performing biblical mortifications. They had to lock him up in a room. (Gauguin revenant precipitamment il y a 4 jours et la nouvelle de Vincent a lhopital.

La veille de mon depart (car il devait quitter Arles) Vincent a couru apres moi (il sortait cetait la nuit) je me suis retourne car depuis quelques temps il devenait tres drole mais je men defiais. Alors il ma dit: Vous etes taciturne mais moi je le serai aussi. Depuis que je devais quitter Arles il etait tellement bizarre que je ne vivais plus. Il mavait meme dit: Vous allez partir? Et comme javais dit Oui il a arrache dun journal cette phrase et me la mise dans la main: le meurtrier a pris la fuite. Je suis alle coucher a lhotel et quand je suis revenu tout Arles etait devant chez nous. Alors les gendarmes mont arrete car la maison etait pleine de sang. Voici ce qui setait passe.

The method described by Van Gogh was recommended by Raspail as a means of curbing masturbation. See Manuel annuaire de la sante. Paris 1886 pp. 89-92 373. Raspails books were especially popular among labourers. His best-known work was Manuel annuaire de la sante which had been published every year since 1845.

This personage from Numa Roumestan a book Van Gogh mentions later in the letter appears again in Daudets Tartarin sur les Alpes. Bompard is a dreamer and a liar (a condition caused by the devastatingly hot sun of the south) and surpasses all his fellow Tarasconians in this respect. Bompards imaginary Switzerland is mentioned in Confidences sous un tunnel (Secrets in a tunnel chapter 5) in Tartarin sur les Alpes. See Daudet 1986-1994 vol. 3 pp. 593-596. Van Goghs mention of the fall actually refers to La catastrophe (The catastrophe chapter 13). Bompard and Tartarin tied together for a hike in the mountains come to an impasse. They both cut themselves free each assuming that this has caused the death of the other. Later the braggart Bompard claims that he tried to save Tartarin. In addition to telling this lie he has broken the vow the friends had made to help each other in need no matter what. The rope to which Van Gogh refers which symbolizes broken promises is found at the end of the chapter (pp. 667-675) marking this passage is an illustration of a knotted rope with two severed ends. See for instance ed. Paris 1886 p",,,"In a letter written to Van Gogh in June 1888 Gauguin had outlined his plan to start dealing in Impressionist paintings Van Gogh dismissed his scheme as a fata Morgana.

Cest encore la ou se trouvent les sommites et certainement vous devriez consulter un specialiste pour vous guerir de la folie. Ne le sommes-nous pas tous?) See Gauguin 1923 p. 13","This reveals that Gauguin had asked in the missing part of letter 734 for the painting Sunflowers in a vase (F 454 / JH 1562 ) the sunflowers on a yellow background which is also mentioned in letter 739. It had been hanging together with its pendant Sunflowers in a vase (F 456 / JH 1561 ) in Gauguins room in Arles (letter 743). Van Gogh did not want to trade F 454 for the studies Gauguin had left behind and suggested making a repetition as a compromise (letter 739). He had intended the first two versions of the sunflowers for Theo (letter 741). A short while later he made repetitions of both works: Sunflowers in a vase (F 455 / JH 1668 ) and Sunflowers in a vase (F 458 / JH 1667 ) for the purpose of exchanging them with Gauguin (letters 743 and 745). He had meanwhile decided that the four versions of sunflowers would serve as the wings of two triptychs each with a Berceuse in the middle. This is why he wanted to exchange a Berceuse with Gauguin (see letter 748) with the idea that Gauguin would then have an entire triptych. Later he wrote to Theo that Gauguin was allowed to have the Berceuse but should offer work in exchange for the sunflowers (see letter 776). Gauguin did in fact receive a Berceuse but apparently not the sunflowers. See Van Tilborgh and Hendriks 2001 pp. 24-25. On the basis of their provenance it can be stated that none of the versions of the sunflowers was ever in the possession of Gauguin. See Dorn 1999 pp. 60-61. At the end of April or beginning of May 1889 Van Gogh sent Theo the studies Gauguin had left behind (see letter 765)","In Paris Van Gogh had traded his Sunflowers gone to seed (F 375 / JH 1329 ) and Sunflowers gone to seed (F 376 / JH 1331 ) for Gauguins On the shore of the lake Martinique see letter 576 n","In Marseille Roulin took up the post of courrier-convoyeur (an official in the postal carriage in the train in charge of loading and unloading the postbags at each station and sorting the post during the journey). Van Gogh made a note of Roulins duties and his address in Marseille (see letter 742 Additional details). Roulins wife was staying with their children at her mothers in Lambesc until they could move to Marseille in October 1889 (see letter 814). On 24 January 1889 Theo wrote to his sisters Elisabeth and Willemien: Fortunately I have good news from Vincent and his letters are clearer than they have ever been. Just imagine Roulin has just been transferred. That is a great loss for him. The house physician at the hospital is now the one who can be of the most use to him (FR b919)",,,,"This question also arose in letter 735.

Ichthus (Greek for fish) is a well-known symbol of Christ but there may be an intentional double meaning prompted by Van Goghs account of his mental confusion (Van Gogh spoke of his mental or nervous fever or madness in ll. 102-103). Ictus is a sudden manifestation of a morbid condition affecting the nervous system: amnesiac epileptic ictus (manifestation brutale dun etat morbide affectant le systeme nerveux: ictus amnesique epileptique) (TLF).

In letter 739 he wrote to Gauguin: As an Impressionist arrangement of colours I have never devised anything better (ll. 72-74). The then innovative style of De kleine Johannes does indeed have Impressionistic traits particularly in the many descriptions of nature with their countless colour adjectives.

He talks to me about painting but sometimes he loses his train of thought and speaks nothing but disjointed words and jumbled phrases (FR b1057). For this letter see Documentation 12 February 1889. Acting on the orders of chief of police Joseph dOrnano (see letter 750) the doctor Albert Delon examined Van Gogh on 7 February. Delon was a member of the hospital board and employed as a doctor by the Bureau de bienfaisance (Lindicateur marseillais 1889). He wrote the following in his report: I found this man in a state of extreme excitement suffering from a true delirium pronouncing incoherent words only momentarily recognising the people around him. He is subject in particular to auditory hallucinations (he hears voices uttering reproaches against him) and to an idee fixe according to which he is supposed to have been the victim of an attempted poisoning.

At last Ive had another letter from the Rev. Salles. Just as I had thought his condition is the same and not at all better. So that its now as good as decided that hell be transferred to Aix. I expected this but now it is certain that it will be a long time before he is again completely healthy (FR b921). This letter from Salles is not known. Several days earlier the sisters Elisabeth and Willemien had placed their share of the inheritance of 678.23 francs at Vincents disposal to pay for his care. Theo wrote about this on 10 March 1889 to his brother-in-law Joan van Houten and his sister Anna van Houten-Van Gogh: Thank you very much for your letters which I received yesterday with the enclosed postal order for 678.23 francs which amount Lies and Wil place at Vincents disposal. At the moment theres no reason to change his present treatment which is free. He is well cared for in the municipal hospital where nursing is provided free of charge and according to the advice both of the house physician who is very well disposed towards Vincent and me and of my doctor here who treated Vincent when he was here its best to leave him there for the time being to see whether rest and regular care can put him to rights. Should the contrary be deemed necessary that he be admitted to a special nursing home we must decide to what extent paid care needs to be provided. I appreciate that you would like to contribute if needed but that probably wont be necessary. Ill deposit the money from Lies and Wil with a banker until its necessary to use it for him but I dont think that this will be the case. As you know Vincent gave this money to the girls and Cor influenced by a reproach that he had used more money for his education than the other children. I dont think that he would take it back no matter what the circumstances if he could judge for himself. It is however a reserve in case other means should prove insufficient. At the moment I have no other news from him than that which you have probably heard from Ma (FR b920).

In the report he was accused of lewd behaviour: The women especially no longer feel comfortable because he is prone to touching them inappropriately and makes obscene remarks in their presence (Les femmes surtout ne sont plus rassurees car il se livre sur elles a des attouchements et tient des propos obscenes en leur presence). Ornanos conclusion reads as follows: Mr Vincent van Gogh is truly suffering from mental disturbance however we have noted on several occasions that this madman has moments of lucidity. Van Gogh is not yet a threat to public safety but there are fears that he may become so. All his neighbours are frightened and with good cause because a few weeks ago the madman concerned cut off an ear in a fit of insanity a crisis that could be repeated and be harmful to somebody in his vicinity.

We went out together yesterday afternoon and again this morning. He took me to see his paintings of which many are very good and all of them very intriguing. His kind doctor the house physician Rey believes that if he had a very methodical life eating and drinking normally and at regular times there would be every chance that his terrible crises would not be repeated. He is strongly disposed to keep him for as long as necessary. He thinks that the costs of this stay should fall to the municipality since it is at the councils request that he is being kept in the hospital. In any case if he does not return to Paris which would be preferable in Mr Reys opinion he would have to move house as his neighbours are hostile towards him. That is also the wish of your brother who would like to be taken away as soon as possible from this hospital where he must indeed be suffering from this constant surveillance that must often be petty-minded. In short I found him I assure you in the most perfect state of health and reason. He wishes for one thing only to be able to work undisturbed. Therefore act so as to provide him with that happiness. How sad this life must be for him! (Jai trouve votre frere en parfait etat de sante physique et moral. Nous sommes sortis ensemble hier apres midi et encore ce matin.

Only one of them can be traced with certainty to the family estate: The Alyscamps (Leaf-fall) (F 487 / JH 1621 ). His list contains two canvases of the Alyscamps and it is plausible that he also sent F 486 / JH 1620 which had been hanging in Gauguins room together with F 487 (see letter 716). These two paintings were part of the decoration as were a number of other works which he here describes as worthy of being put on stretching frames. Feilchenfeldt and cat.

The first two versions F 456 / JH 1561 and F 454 / JH 1562 were indeed in the consignment but cannot be the paintings in question because they were already framed with strips of wood and thus already on stretching frames (see letter 776). Sunflowers in a vase (F 458 / JH 1667 ) must have been sent on a stretching frame too Van Gogh had enlarged the composition by adding a strip of wood to the canvas (see Hendriks et al. 2019). This means that the painting could not be taken off the stretching frame anymore.

The Vollard archives contain only two references to a painting of the Alyscamps which possibly allude to one and the same work: the payment of 70.70 francs to Ginoux for a canvas by Van Gogh Alyscamps (toile de Van Gogh alyscamps) and the sum of 310 francs received from Denys Cochin for Van Gogh alyscamps (Paris Musee dOrsay Documentation Archives Vollard MS 421). By contrast Dorn thought that Van Gogh sent all four paintings of the Alyscamps to Theo but that the two canvases in this list of works worthy of being put on stretching frames were F 568 / JH 1622 and F 569 / JH 1623. He assumed in fact that Van Gogh sent F 486 and F 487 on their stretching frames as he did the canvases of sunflowers that had also hung in Gauguins room and already had frames made of strips of wood (see letter 776).

In the present letter Van Gogh mentions a garden thats in the walnut frame (l. 52) so that painting The public garden (The poets garden) (F 468 / JH 1578 ) (see n. 7 below) was also in the consignment (cf. also letter 777). The consignment contained four versions of Augustine Roulin (La berceuse) namely F 504 / JH 1655 F 506 / JH 1670 F 507 / JH 1672 and F 508 / JH 1671 as well as Joseph Roulin (F 436 / JH 1675 ) Sower with setting sun (F 450 / JH 1627 ) Marcelle Roulin (F 441 / JH 1641 ) Starry night over the Rhone (F 474 / JH 1592 ) and Van Goghs chair (F 498 / JH 1635 ). See letter 774. It is likely that Gauguins chair (F 499 / JH 1636 ) was sent together with its pendant F 498 (cf. letter 736). In addition to the two previously mentioned canvases with sunflowers the consignment must also have contained F 456 / JH 1561 F 454 / JH 1562 F 453 / JH 1559 F 459 / JH 1560 and F 457 / JH 1666 .

Unlike that work however we know that F 468 definitely had a walnut frame (see letter 699 cf. also letter 673 n. 16). It is also more likely that Van Gogh who was very keen on contrasts when choosing pendants selected a painting of the poets garden to pair with F 517 and not F 566 which shows the same area of the park as in F 517 in an almost identical composition","Van Gogh links these two artists to the Foreign Legion because both had painted military scenes. Edouard Detaille made military history paintings the caricaturist Caran dAche (the pseudonym of Emmanuel Poire) had become known in 1886 for his designs for the shadow play Lepopee (Epic) about the Napoleonic campaigns for the Cabaret du Chat Noir in Montmartre","Van Gogh thought at first that the cost of bed and board in the asylum was 80 francs a month (letter 760) in the meantime he had learned from Salles that the minimum would be 100 francs (letter 765).

A comparison of Young man with a cap (F 536 / JH 1648) with the two portraits F 492 / JH 1642 and F 493 / JH 1643 suggests that this too is a portrait of Armand Roulin.

First article) by Edmond Jacques in LIntransigeant of 1 May 1889 pp. 1-2. Van Gogh refers to a passage that discusses two works by Maurice Lobre: They are modest interiors with a fragrance of intimacy in a delightful key. The green sitting room decorated with green pots darkened by green curtains into which a faint light slips through a half-open door is an exquisitely delicate little jewel. The girl at luncheon is also very charming but it does not have the same unity and does not please the eye to the same degree. (Ce sont des interieurs modestes tout parfumes dintimite dans une note charmante. Le salon vert orne de poteries vertes assombri de rideaux verts ou glisse une faible lumiere par une porte entrouverte est un petit bijou dune exquise delicatesse. Le dejeuner de la fille est fort charmant aussi mais il na pas la meme unite et ne flatte pas au meme point le regard.) Van Gogh had apparently taken these to be a single painting of a woman in an interior. Both works bore the title Interieur in the catalogue of the Salon. See exhib","After mentioning a few mediocre portraits Edmond Jacques goes on to say: Mr Mathey is more incisive. His two young woman are interpreted with a most subtle art. And yet I prefer to them the etcher Rops that masterpiece from last year. (M. Mathey est plus penetrant. Ses deux jeunes femmes sont interpretees avec un art tres subtil. Je leur prefere cependant laqua-fortiste Rops cette oeuvre maitresse de lan dernier.)

I have no need to wait. Its certain. Its a matter of fact that Mr Besnard has painted no ordinary thing. His Sirene is a young woman with a strange expression leaning against a tree at the edge of a lake. It would be nothing if that was all there was. But the artist has chosen that time of day when through an effect of the sunset the lake its Lake Annecy assumes a pink colour absolutely pink. This phenomenon does not last long but it is repeated regularly every evening. Every traveller has observed it. No matter! Its the exception and voices will be raised at it I say so again. Ah well I shall not raise mine for two reasons: the first is that I am sure of the masters sincerity the second is that this piece destined in advance to be the object of every exclamation fashionable or otherwise is admirably painted and that there emanates from it a profound and disturbing poetry. (Aussi on criera fort contre M. Besnard. Je nai pas besoin dattendre. Cest certain. Il est de fait que M. Bernard [sic] na pas peint une chose ordinaire.

One of the studies Two vases of flowers (Bremen Kunsthalle) was included in the retrospective exhibition in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1885 which Theo had visited.

(Oui il y a un peu de casseur dassiettes mais si javais ete la le tout aurait ete fait plus simplement). He also explained why Lautrec had not been allowed to exhibit: As far as Lautrec is concerned I believe the truest reason is that Lautrec thinks of one thing only thats himself and not the others. So its probable that these gentlemen will have judged it preferable to do the same i.e. to manage without him.

For the text with commentary and an English translation see exhib",,,,,,,,"New York 1986 pp. 310-315. In his article Aurier praises Van Goghs strange intense and feverish work (oeuvres etranges intensives et fievreuses) and calls him a worthy successor to the seventeenth-century Dutch masters. In his eyes Van Gogh is not only a realist with a great love for nature and for truth but also a symbolist who uses his idiom to express an Idea (une Idee). He dreams of artistic innovation in the form of an art of the tropical regions (art des regions tropicales) striving to produce naive primitive art that appeals to simple souls. With regard to Van Goghs technique he writes that it matches his artistic temperament: vigorous exalted brutal intense (vigoureuse exaltee brutale intensive). His palette is incredibly dazzling (invraisemblablement eblouissante) and his brushstrokes fiery very powerful and full of tension (fougueux tres puissants et tres nerveux). Aurier closes his article by lamenting that Van Gogh will never be completely understood for he is too simple and at the same time too subtle for the contemporary bourgeois mind (a la fois trop simple et trop subtil pour lesprit-bourgeois contemporain). Aurier published a shortened version of his article under the title Vincent van Gogh in LArt Moderne. Revue Critique des Arts et de la Litterature 10 (19 January 1890) no. 3 pp. 20-22 as is apparent from the first paragraph: One of the artists who will be most widely discussed at the Salon of Les Vingt around whom a great mass of ignorant nonsense will accumulate Vincent van Gogh has recently been studied very closely by Mr G. Albert Aurier in a subtle and very interesting article published in the Mercure de France (the former Pleiade) January 1890 number. As we are unable to print the whole article because of its length we believe it useful to provide extracts from it (Lun des artistes qui seront les plus discutes au Salon des XX celui devant lequel saccumuleront en tas les ignorances et les inepties Vincent Van Gogh vient detre etudie de tres pres par M.

Theo also sent the article to Mrs van Gogh (see letter 850 n. 2) his sister Lies and the art critic Jan Veth.

The Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant of Friday 4 April 1890 included an enthusiastic article on the exhibition: One of the exhibitors at this gathering is a Dutchman Mr Vincent van Gogh who is celebrated by the true devotees of the new light as the best among their adepts and who deserves this honour in many respects. He does not dot his landscapes but paints them with facets approximately the size of a segment of a finger. If one stands up close one doesnt know what one sees one is confronted with inexplicable chaos. But if one moves some distance away one must admire the bold and original idea then trees and paving stones and clouds take on shapes that one hadnt understood at first glance and hadnt discovered. This style of painting is indeed the last word in oddness. But there is something in it that is certain. One may call the means coarse and unpolished but the painter would not boast about putting on white kid gloves. Mr van Gogh the art buyer in boulevard Montmartre the brother of this painter is ever on the look-out for these innovators of painting and it is mainly owing to his tireless efforts that justice is done to such painters as Monet and Raffaelli and Pissarro ... and that they find acceptance among the public who are starting to buy their work more and more.

If only hes not melancholy and heading for another crisis it was all going so well (See FR b2058 Brief happiness 1999 pp. 249-250 with a small change in the translation)","This refers to the firm of Boussod Valadon & Cie","Andries had withdrawn his offer to be Theos business associate.

On 22 July Theo informed his mother and Willemien about his interview with his employers the day before (about which he says nothing at all to Vincent): I havent written to you since Ive been back because I was waiting for a resolution on the part of the Gentlemen. On the way and coming back here I realized so clearly that recklessly giving up my position to plunge into uncertainty was a very dangerous matter for I did have hope of finding the money to start my own business but was not sure of it by any means. I thought about it so much that I was nearly desperate about having let things come so far and perhaps being very soon without one penny of income. So yesterday morning I had another talk with the Gentlemen and found that they are not really ill-disposed towards me. I said that when I had first spoken I had had rather a lot of faith in my lucky stars and had not thought enough about the power of the firm but that on second thoughts I had come to the conclusion that it was wiser for me to stay and that even if they thought I didnt deserve a rise I would reconcile myself to it and manage to get by. Etienne B was then very friendly and said that nothing had been decided yet about my salary and that they would see if they could make things easier for me. I only hope that now I can do some business that would surely be the best thing to help them make up their minds but it is a quiet time [for business] (FR b933).",,,,"a.

"RM05",,"The authorship of this piece of prose is problematic. There are no other examples of feigned letters to artists written by Van Gogh (salutation date and signature are lacking and Souvestre had already died in 1854). However the appearance of Van Goghs name below the fragment in the album from Theo Elisabeths remark about That piece from Vincent as well as the lack of a source on the sheet suggest that the text was written by Van Gogh. It is possible that he wrote it first in Dutch (see Date). Martin Bailey assumed that Van Gogh based this romantic little story on the life of Jean Baptiste Loyer the husband of Sarah Ursula Wilson Van Goghs landlady in London. See Martin Bailey Vincent van Gogh the writer The Art Newspaper (February 1994) no. 35 pp. 16-17 also published as Long-hidden skeletons in the Van Gogh family cupboard The European 10 February 1994 pp. 8-9. Nevertheless the idiom is unusual for Van Gogh: the use of the simple past tense the choice of words and the completeness of the sentences are very sophisticated for a 22-year-old Dutchman. Knowledge of the imperfect subjunctive in pour quil donnat and quon le laissat is not apparent elsewhere in the correspondence. One possibility therefore is that he had the French corrected by a native speaker in Paris. It is unlikely that the grammatical mistake sagravit (instead of saggrava) would occur in a publication read by Van Gogh. This mistake could have been caused by confusion with the verb gravir which is gravit in the third person singular of the simple past tense but Van Gogh might also have copied the word incorrectly from an as yet undiscovered source. Granville incidentally is in Normandy not Brittany. For the texts included in the album that Theo made for Lies see Louis van Tilborgh Notes on a donation: the poetry album for Elisabeth Huberta van Gogh Van Gogh Museum Journal 1995.

Van Gogh himself must have added the phrase et elle pleure sur son epaule (and she weeps on his shoulder) (ll. 95-96) it does not occur in either Consciences manuscript or the editions consulted. Remarkably the early Dutch edition includes precisely in the place where this sentence occurs a print by Eduard Dujardin depicting a girl crying on the conscripts shoulder. It is therefore possible that Van Gogh had read this version of the book earlier and had remembered the illustration while copying out the passage. An indication of this is that his version does not correspond thematically: in the print it is the girl Trien who cries whereas in the text it is the conscripts mother.

"RM21",,"Van Gogh is referring here to J.J. Isaacsons recent writings on the analytical methods and laws of colour adopted by the neo-Impressionists: De revolutionaire schildersgroep in Frankrijk (The revolutionary group of painters in France) De Portefeuille. Kunst- en Letterbode of 10 May 1890 pp. 75-76 and of 17 May 1890 pp. 88-89. Isaacson mentions Van Gogh twice in a list of emotional-impressionistic artists as he characterized them. In his closing sentence he says that he will discuss this anti-official salon group in a subsequent article (p. 89). This explains Van Goghs remark later on in the letter that Isaacson will perhaps mention him in a coming article. Van Gogh views these articles as a continuation of the series titled Parijsche brieven (Paris letters) which Isaacson had written in August-September 1889. On this subject see letter 807 n. 2","In October 1889 Van Gogh had made a similar request to Isaacson see letter 811","Charles-Francois Daubigny is considered a forerunner of Impressionism. Normandian apple trees are a recurring theme in his extensive oeuvre. De Cock was influenced by the Barbizon School to which Daubigny belonged. His influence is particularly discernible in De Cocks Normandian landscapes","Here Van Gogh is probably thinking of Olive grove (F 707 / JH 1857 ) and Olive grove (F 708 / JH 1855 ) which he described in letter 834 as olive trees neutral effect","Van Gogh is presumably referring here to Olive grove (F 586 / JH 1854 ) and Olive pickers (F 587 / JH 1853 ) to which he gave the same colour indications as in letter 834","This description applies to the painting Olive grove (F 710 / JH 1856 ) see letter 863","Van Gogh had painted three variants of the olive trees against a pink sky: Women picking olives (F 654 / JH 1868 ) Women picking olives (F 655 / JH 1869 ) and Women picking olives (F 656 / JH 1870 ).

Van Gogh means that Puvis de Chavanness recent works contain the essence of his vision of society just as the Sermon on the Mount is a summary of Christs teachings.
